<b>CAGE</b><br>
<br>
<b>Winter 2005</b> Cage has been busy getting excellent grades in school as well as having a perfect 100% attendance record. She also beat her own personal running-club record by running 16 laps all together!<br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Cage launched into fifth grade this autumn, ecstatic about her last year of elementary school. She has joined the morning running club and is really looking forward to her school�s Hallowe�en carnival. Legend has it that it rivals the Bellview Elementary carnivals of the past, but one must wait to compare.
