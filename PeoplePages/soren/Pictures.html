<b>SOREN</b><br>
<br>
<b>Winter 2005</b> Soren has just won the districts and regionals in his social studies fair project, a contest in the 
social psychology section with his study on the effects of video games on school performance. We are on to state in Atlanta next. He loves media games but although his media time is limited, therefore very precious, he seems to spend more and more time reading books. Any reading recommendations would be very much appreciated. "Pendragon" series is a favorite along 
with "Artemis Fowl" and "Eragon" topping the list. He also loves to run, play with Joseph and Kira and is enjoying 11 yr. old 
scouts. Sticks are stashed by all the doors to the house, still a favorite play thing.
