<b>JOSEPH</b><br>
<br>
<b>Winter 2005</b> Joseph just started the separation anxiety stage of his development. He'll 
cry whenever any family member leaves a room. That's about the most he's 
cried in his whole life. He's cheerful otherwise. He loves being outside, 
eating dirt and whatever else he can get into his mouth. Although I've fished 
out a nail, beads, felt pads, dog food, cardboard (and the list could go on 
forever) the only thing he has actually choked on is food he eats in his 
highchair. Joseph is walking now and loves to explore anything, anywhere.
