<img src="../../family/famTree/Pictures/diaelmt.jpg" align=left> Being born in New Mexico during World War II, I had the chance to feel the first atomic bomb test blast when it was set off in 1945. We were three hundred miles from the explosion site but still heard and felt it. The ground turned to ripples and everyone was frightened. My life in Bluewater, New Mexico was happy with wonderful parents that loved me and taught me the gospel. I still remember so many things about Bluewater. My Uncle Ray Hassell taught me to walk by letting me hold his tie and he walked backwards till I could do it alone. When we went into town I used to stare at the Indians sitting in the sun by the store drinking soda pop and wish they would give me a drink. Once, my parents took me to town and left me in the car while they stepped into a store. While they were gone I pulled out some change, which I threw out to the people on the sidewalk, and a ten-dollar bill, which I ripped in half. One half of it is still is in my baby book. We had great family dances and get-togethers. Grandfather George played the banjo in the band and all the children would dance, along with the adults, then eventually fall asleep on quilts laid out by the chairs. It was a very close neighborhood, and we all looked out for one another.<br> <br>

When I see my dear 95-year-old aunt Blanche today, I remember my first memory of her outside of her home with long dark hair and her young daughter Emma by her side. I remember her by a campfire washing her clothes. I asked why Emma had a cloth around her neck and she told me, in her childlike way, that Emma had a sore throat. Once I was riding my tricycle and saw a big rattlesnake. I remember running into the house to tell my parents, who were lying on the couch kissing, and them not believing me. My Dad teased me about it for quite a while before finally getting up to check it out. He ended up having to kill the snake. One day my Dad took me to see his crashed airplane--uncle Don had borrowed his plane and forgotten to put the landing gear down. It was a warm summer day and we rode in a Jeep to the crash site with me wearing a sunsuit and my short, curly blond hair blowing in the wind. Dad's face was so sad as he looked at the plane. He had years of payments to go on the crashed plane but never held it against his brother. I learned forgiveness from my father. <img src="../../family/famTree/Pictures/diafam.jpg" align=right>My Dad had five brothers and most of them ended up having their own airports. Uncle Don had his in California and flew Governor Reagan (who later became President) for a living. My cousin Lavonn George was so special to me. I also loved Apryl her younger sister (two years older than me) and Clark her brother. Often I would go over to their house to spend the night and listen to talk-radio shows on their big livingroom radio. One day twelve year old Lavonn rode her bike out on the runway to greet her father and got too close to his taxing airplane and was hit in the head with the propeller. She was rushed to the hospital, but didn't make it. Some of the grandchildren were taken to Grandmother George's home to stay while their parents were gone. Grandmother was so sweet to tend the children and let all the others go to the hospital. I remember her fireplace and hardwood floors with her hand braided rag rugs. The home usually had such a happy atmosphere, but I remember seeing something wrong in my Grandmother's expression. She was sitting in her rocking chair looking very somber. I must have seen tears on her face. I kept asking her if she was happy, she looked so quiet and not her normal smiling self. She kept saying she was okay in her sweet way. Lavonn was very special and sweet and all who knew her loved her. It was a horribly tragic day. Uncle Stan and aunt Violet George also lived nearby. They had red chilli clusters hanging in their kitchen and colorful curtains made from Mexican blankets. I loved the brightness and color they brought into their home. Uncle Stan had made a little playhouse outside for the children and I thought it was so beautiful. Claudia and Dick were their children who I played with when we would visit. Once Claudia tried to show me how to make hand lotion out of mucus from her nose. I was so impressed with her knowledge, as she was three years older than I was. When I passed on the knowledge to Mother she set me straight. Uncle Lee and Aunt Genavie were special. They had a boy close to my age and their oldest daughter Genalee, eleven years older then I, was the first grandchild of Grandpa and Grandma Hassell. Aunt Genavie was of Indian decent and a real angle on Earth. Uncle Lee built her a home when they married and she died in that home in May of 2002. Her great deeds could fill a book, but one of her kindness acts was to take needy children into her home. She had eight children of her own but ended up raising many others. Her eldest son took after her and raised seven others, in addition to his own, that needed a home. Aunt Mary was my Grandfather George's sister and the local midwife who never lost a mother. She always got down on her knees before she delivered a baby to ask God for help. She delivered my father, mother and was with my mother in the hospital bossing the doctors around when I was born.<br><br>

<img src="../../family/famTree/Pictures/diakthln.jpg" align=left>When I was three my brother Randy and I piled on top of all the household things in the back seat of our black car with running boards and squealed with delight at the great excitement we felt in moving to Oregon. Many of our relatives from Bluewater moved to Oregon as well. It was 1948. Our mother was pregnant with our sister Kathleen and our father was going to become a logger. We moved into a tiny rented basement (that my Dad couldn't fully stand up in) until Dad and Uncle Ray could finish building a bigger home. The house they built was so well made that after more than 50 years it still has the same siding, roofing, windows and 4X6 wood framing. I felt so happy in that home and have never forgotten it. I started school at Walker Elementary and walked to school with my many cousins and friends everyday. Aunt Blanche Hakes lived near us and used to hold big taffy pulls that I loved. She'd lived in our house for a while, but moved out after my Mother and Dad had a water fight with a hose in the house. Dad and Mother always had lots of fun and lots of laughs. Now they had four children, and only two bedrooms, so we had to move again. Uncle Ralph lived next door and served in the Korean War. Uncle Les across the street (they made their house into a really good Mexican restaurant). Monte Jones lived just two doors down. We lived near a pear orchard. Randy, John, Kathleen and I use to play we were hunting quails with our popguns.  The boys would lie in the grass by the willow trees to hunt and I would serve lunch and love playing with my brothers and sister. Once my brother Randy, sister Kathleen and I took weeping willows sticks and put them in the earth in long rows all along the border of our land. Today the big willow trees are still standing and the pears in the orchard are the best I have ever eaten. When John was a baby he was so extra beautiful that we loved to dress him up to look like a girl. We would take him to Dad when he would come in from logging, as Dad loved to hold his babies and kiss his children hello after work. My Dad had a logging gas pump in the back yard and the trucks took off at four in the morning each day of the workweek. He would give us all a turn riding with him for a day in the log truck and watching in the woods as he loaded the truck with logs all day. We had lots of fun with him, but Randy was always afraid the squirrels would get hurt and begged Dad not to run over the 'kitty cats' as they drove through the woods. When Dad would dump the logs in the log ponds he would put us in the truck and keep us safe. Logs killed several men in our ward when they were taking the chains off. Uncle Ray Hassell found a solution to the problem by inventing log stakes and bunks to hold logs in place on the truck. Uncle Ray sold his truck to get money and equipment to start the log stake business, and was able to retire young on the proceeds. <br>

<img border=2 align=left src=../../Pictures/dennis.jpg><a class=times70>M</a>
om and I have been married for almost 45 years. The greatest complimentary feeling I have for her is that never in all those years was I ever tempted by any other female. I always felt that I had the best woman in the world for me. I have always been satisfied with everything a husband could want in a woman who took care of our  home and children. I have never met any woman who tried harder than she did to do the right thing.  Her objectives were always honest and righteous.  She never wavered from the truth as she saw it. Unflinching and unbending when it came to doing the right thing. She makes good yogurt and granola, only I never liked yogurt or granola. She never got a traffic violation ticket and she never ever broke the Word of Wisdom, and had to convert me from Pepsi very, very early in our relationship. I have always felt that in order for me to be able to reach the Celestial Kingdom, it would be important for me to stand close to her and work together with her. I always thought that Diana would have survived the Willie and Martin handcart experience. I love her very much and she has survived me.

om is the single most influential person in my life. I love her with all of my heart. Mom taught me to be the person that I am. She taught me to eat things I disliked by telling me stories that helped me get through the discomfort. She taught me how to be honest in all things. She taught me how to be frugal. She taught me how to listen. By watching her example, I had no fear of marriage or parenthood and because of her those things seemed natural to me. My favorite memory of Mom is laying my head on her lap as a child and having her run her fingers through my hair, very comforting. I love you Mom. Happy Mothers Day!

<img border=2 align=left src=../../Pictures/karen.jpg><a class=times70>T</a>
he memory that stands out most in my mind about Mom is the first time I saw her. I had come up to Ashland to meet Dane's family and was in the house by the counter. She was gone when I got there but came soon after. She walked into the door and I spotted her. She was huge and pregnant with Nial and wearing this LOUD yellow and black striped shirt with HUGE dark hair and she came at me with a glistening face and huge smile and said, "Oh, Karen, there you are...I thought you were a brunette!" Then she gave me this huge sincere hug and told me how happy she was that I was there and that I was blonde. I don't know why it stands out so much in my mind, just because until you experience her, no one can really prepare you for her eccentric-ness. Not a bad thing at all, just very different.

emories of you include taffy pulls and not having to work on my birthday. Getting perms while watching Gone With the Wind. No pressure to do homework, in fact I remember sneaking to do it so you wouldn�t find out and get mad. Watermelon and bread and butter lunches during the summertime. Blackberry cobblers. Camping. A fondness for practical jokes. Waking up to hear the vacuum in the middle of the night (probably only like 10pm, but since I fall asleep early it seemed like the middle of the night). Watching you get ready to go out somewhere and being fascinated by the transformation. Making dinnertime full of atmosphere. Your love for telling stories and making work into a game. I�m so glad you are my mom, and that you tried your best always. You have inspired me to try to be the best mom I can possibly be. I love you.

<img border=2 align=left src=../../Pictures/scott.jpg><a class=times70>T</a>o Diana Cluff, Wishing You a Happy Mother�s Day!<br><br>
When Melanie and I started dating, Diana required that Shira go along with us. Shira was two years old at the time and effectively negated any of my romantic make-out plans. Melanie had plenty of self-control, as alluring as I was. But Shira�s presence ensured that our sights remained fixed firmly on a temple marriage. <br><br>

Diana gave me my first taste of healing clay. This convinced me to spend the rest of my life debunking inexpensive home remedies, although after six weeks I did feel a little better. No doubt the interaction of clay and Echinacea saved me from what could have happened, like ulcers and the inevitable moral decay from watching M.A.S.H. reruns on TV.<br><br>

The evening before our marriage, Diana graciously offered to provide the mandatory Cluff �sex talk.� Following her promises to be very descriptive, I made a hasty exit. My own mother had been somewhat descriptive during my early and impressionable childhood. I always believed that this only served to fuel my older brother�s active curiosity. It served to confuse me. <br><br>

My most treasured birthday gift had emerged from the barn. It was a nice polyester jump suit, perfect for my active lifestyle. Aside from the stains and small holes in embarrassing areas, and the full-length zipper, it was a hit among my cycling buddies. I used it for sports and to perform baptisms. Diana pegged my size and needs perfectly.<br><br>

While I do not always understand Diana�s methods, I have never questioned her wholesome desires and intentions to help us all improve our physical and spiritual well-being, along with our sense of fashion. I still have the jump suit. Sometimes I just like to put it on and stare at myself in a full-length mirror.<br><br> 

Happy Mother�s Day.

hen I think about mom, sometimes it's hard for me to get past the fact that we don't agree very often. Almost my whole life I have been on the other side of almost every debate with mom. You could say we fundamentally disagree on nearly everything.  However, the most amazing thing is that the older I get, the more I realize how much mom and I have in common. <br> <br>
    
We are both a little more eccentric than people expect when they first meet us.  We both find eternal pleasure in making teenagers slightly embarrassed.  We both have way too much on our plate, but somehow we seem to get most everything done properly and on time. We both enjoy playing with children, but are thankful when their parents come to collect them. We both believe a firm hand in raising children tempered with humor and a little bit of random flexibility ultimately makes the toughest and most well-rounded adults.  Mom and I both agree that the most important thing in your life is family. Of all the things that run through my head when I think about mom, that point of harmony between us trumps them all. I love you mom, and the only reason I'm a good mom is because I learned it all from you.

ru has developed a fascination with bugs (go figure) and Natasha was having some problems trying to persuade her to leave the bugs outside the house.  Nat called mom and she talked with Dru for at least 20 minutes, using all her powers to help Dru understand that bugs need to be with their families; that they need to take care of their baby bugs and that if you don't leave the bugs outside they would perish.  At the end of the conversation mom was amazed that for every argument, Dru had a sensible counter argument.  At the end of it all, mom told Nat good luck and to get creative because even her stories about the chickens didn't change Dru's mind about how bugs would be happier in her hands than outside in the wild.

om has lots of admirable traits but the three things I admire most are her sense of humor, her skills with children and the way she stands out in a crowd. <br> <br>

Mom is so much fun! She�s funny, quirky, entertaining and can always take a joke. It was fantastic growing up in a house where limbo was a regular fixture, where the threat of being turned into a strange creature if you failed to do your work always loomed and where being woken up by a silly catch phrase or music on full blast was much more likely than a boring old alarm. Mom never even veered towards depression (an amazing feat given the amount of offspring she raised with only one bathroom), everything was always light and fun - everything was a game. How lame would life have been without taffy pulls, Groundhog�s Day, themed dinners, dancing to Hooked on Classics, hotdog roasts, Wrestlers of America, motorhome trips (yes, even them), the barn, elderberries, pomegranates, olive pit, classic movies (Seven Brides, Paleface, Some Like it Hot, Emigrant Saga, etc), picnics, rat stories, herbs, the medicine cabinet and I could go on ad infinitum! Life would be unbearable without a sense of humor. One of the main reasons I married Edward was because I knew he would keep me in the style to which I had become accustom � happiness, laughter and fun. Thanks Mom for cultivating that sense of the ridiculous in us all! <br> <br>   

Mom is a magician with kids. She�s always had an amazing knack for dealing with, talking to and fascinating children. She enchants them with her amazing energy and imaginative games. How could you not be captivated by her wide-eyed storytelling (esp. Thumpkin Pie), charmed by her assurance that every car journey would be an adventure or inspired to break the record in the dishwasher unloading challenge? I�ve never met a kid who didn�t warm to Mom. She really has a talent. Don�t forget, this is the woman who landscaped her entire yard with thousands of rocks gathered over several long, hot days by kids motivated only by the prospect of a quick dip in the muddy lake from whence they came! Magic, I tell you! 
 <br> <br>   

Having lived in England for a while now, I�ve learned to appreciate a good eccentric. And thank heavens for them! They�re the spice of life. How boring would everything be if we all slavishly followed everyone else and never broke the mold? It�d be like being back in middle school! I love that mom dresses, decorates and lives in a way that clashes with convention. I love that she dares to be different in an increasingly homogenous world. She has the courage to follow her own unique sense of style without caring what anyone else thinks � and that makes her very cool in my book. I feel super lucky to have such a fantastic character for a mother. She�s the best! Go Mom!

 do not have a conventional mother-in-law. <BR><br>

The first time we ever met was at San Francisco airport, which we liked so much we stayed there for almost 24 hours. Daisha had tried to prepare me for meeting her family, but neither her great (and inevitably wide ranging) descriptive abilities nor her diagram could really do justice to the characters involved; least of all Diana. I was fully mentally prepared for the kind of experience one often has when meeting the family of a friend: 
<Br><br>
	 - unending hours of meaningless small talk
<br>
	 - occasional uncomfortable silences
<br>
	 - a slight sense of exclusion from the private jokes and nuances of a long-establish family dynamic
<br>
<br>

I was somewhat surprised, therefore, that just a couple of hours later I was feeling far from excluded. In fact I was firmly ensconced at the heart of the family, on my knees, in a motorhome, being encouraged to solicit the almighty to intervene and make just a small one-off exception on our behalf, to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, in order to get the battery working. I was reeling from the shock of the omission of this methodology from any of my electrical engineering lectures... perhaps I'd just wasted 4 years of my life? <br><br>

I was not given much time to ponder this, however, as there were no uncomfortable silences into which one might insert such a disturbing mental contortion. In fact Daisha and Diana collectively conspired to ensure that there were absolutely no silences of any description. The merest hint of a silence was sprung upon and soundly beaten into submission with an avalanche of gossip, advice, jokes and recollections.

There was no small talk either. We barely got past our hellos before Diana was giving me the full run-down on all her gynaecological adventures and successes. At the time I thought this a little unusual, but nevertheless a welcoming and refreshingly open manner of introducing oneself. As I've come to understand her more, however, I can now see that this is really the perfect way to be introduced to Diana: it gets the most important stuff out there right from the start; Diana is all about her children, and about her family. <br><br>

She may not always be able to convince us all of the benefits of her herbal remedies, sleeping under the stars, the extremes of her thriftiness, nor even sometimes her indomitable faith, but she has achieved greatness. She has raised her family and instilled in them her sense of fun, of generosity, kindness, hard work, the importance of helping others, of family, of raising children. She leads by example; smiling in the face of setbacks, always coming up with exciting new ideas and above all, being unique, being herself, and having total confidence and faith in her beliefs.

hese quotes were created and immortalized by Mom: <br>
<li>"Awake and arise, ye defenders of the faith!"<br>

<li>"Win some, lose some."<br>

<li>"Have a hot one!<br>

<li>"Best ______ in high school!"<br><br>

Things I will always associate mom with:<br>

Slippers, herbs, fasting, breastfeeding, mullein tea, blessings, Thumpkin Pie, �distinctive� handwriting, the Indian boy/girl song (potty training), hot pink & purple, wallpaper on any and every surface, big 80s hair, wigs, �creative� spelling, Yes mother dear, false eyelashes (especially ones that are winking at me on the shower wall), jungles, Arabian robes, pina colada, anything tropical, gardenias, meals-on-wheels, mending piles, camping, no kissing and anything Mormonish.<br><br>

My most memorable wig memories:<br>
<li>While we lived in Lake of the Pines, I once started talking to mom while she was in her chair (turned away from me). Her hair was hanging over the back of the chair like she was cooling her neck and resting. She wouldn�t respond to me, so I went around the front of the chair to see why and I saw that she wasn�t even sitting there. It was just her wig hanging on the chair!

<li>We were driving through Ashland on the boulevard up by the high school. The windows were down because we didn�t have A/C, and suddenly the front half of her wig flipped back and started flapping in the wind, exposing her �unflattering� hair beneath! Mom yelped for help since she had to keep a hand on the steering wheel. I was laughing to the point of tears, so with blurry vision, I flapped her wig back down and bobby pinned it back in place. 

<li>Telling mom when her bobby pins were visible

<li>Jumping up and down in the aisles at Goodwill, or any other store, looking for mom�s poofy hair because I�d gotten lost from her in the store.

<li>Thanks to mom�s wig-wearing throughout my entire life, I can spot a wig from a mile away.<br><br> 

Mom was fun to have as a mother growing up because we just got to run wild in the yard all day eating real mud pies, playing in the creek, building forts, riding bikes, digging with her spoons (oh yeah, she didn�t like that) and just having a blast being a kid in general.  
Although I didn�t care too much for the homemade bread sandwiches that were � inch thick on one side and 4 inches thick on the other due to mom�s impaired bread slicing abilities, she had daycare kids that I was able to mooch off of and trade meals with! When I got older, there were a lot of chores, but I�m grateful for the work ethic I developed from having all those responsibilities. I�m looking forward to all the work I�ve done in the yard paying off when I finally get the house (since I�ve wanted it since birth and I�m the only kid who doesn�t want to bulldoze it�hint, hint). I can�t imagine having a better mother who could have taught me the value of hard work and values as well as mom did. I�ll probably be a slave driver to my kids too, but I imagine they�ll thank me one day for it also. She always took us camping, especially on my birthday, and created the Olive Pit and Arbuckle traditions. I�ll love Olive Pit forever and ever!!!! Who else would have thought to make such a random place a traditional stopping place for the family? Thanks for all the memories, mom. And for always being home and being there when I needed you! You even watched my kids for me so I could get away with Hyrum. You�ve done that for a lot of your kids! I�m so grateful I have the opportunity to be with you eternally in our perfected states. Thanks for everything! Happy Mothers Day to the BEST MOM IN THE WORLD!

or my other Mom, <br><br>
When I think of mom there are a lot of things that go through my head. Tomatoes rising out of jars that we where not allowed to throw out because they might need to be used. I think of the first time coming into the house and feeling like I was in someone's skirt. Seeing more clothes in one place at one time, then anywhere else I have ever seen. I think of hotdog roasts and �being the best in high school�. I think of how every time we come down to see her she is always smiling and so happy to see us and how  kind she is and always has a compliment to give and a good story. (Might have heard it before but still a good one). <br><br>
She always has an idea for something that will keep her and a small army busy for a whole year, (it�s a good things she has one). No matter what though she loves her children and is always hoping well for them and when some would give up, she still is holding fast that all will be well. She has more faith then anyone I know and always magnifies her callings. If she is asked to have one year food supply she has 10 years. She likes to have toys, boats, motor homes and vehicles, but is always willing to share those toys and buy them so her family can enjoy them too.<br> <br>
Mom always wants to help and strives to make every one a better person. For one thing I am especially thankful for is the daughter that she raised. She has a special bond with her mom and loves her to no end. I have to say thank you for raising the best woman in the world for me. Thanks for being such a great grammie to my kids, they love you so much and so do I. Thank you so much for everything. For your faith and trust in me in my dreams and goals. Thank you, love you MOM.

iana: Hyatt, what do you want to say to Grammie?<br>

Hyatt: Thank you<br><br>

Tiana: What else?<br><br>

Hyatt: Nuffing (nothing)<br><br>

Tiana: Well, what do you like about Grammie�s house? What�s at Grammie�s house?<br><br>

Hyatt: Kickins (chickens)<br><br>

Tiana: What else?<br><br>

Hyatt: Swimming pool<br><br>

Tiana: What else?<br><br>

Hyatt: Trampowine<br><br>

Tiana: Do you like Grammie�s house?<br><br>

Hyatt: Yeah<br><br>

(Apparently done with me asking him questions, Hyatt then goes in his room and shuts his  
door.)<br><br>

Tiana: Hyatt, come here.<br><br>

Hyatt: No<br><br>

Tiana: Come here! One...Two...<br><br>

Hyatt: Yes mudder dear<br><br>

Grammie has successfully taught my children how to say �Yes mother dear,� and they say it  
all the time! Thanks! Hyatt also runs around the yard singing the Indian boy song. And when he drums on things with sticks, he again sings the Indian boy song. He really loves  
Grammie, although when asked about staying with Grammie while we were gone, he still  
furrows his brow and says �I miss my mommy and daddy.�

hough Kiersa is too young to tell me what she thinks of Grammie, I�m sure she loves her a lot because Mom always says Kiersa looks like me (Tiana) and acts like I did as a baby, and since I love mom so much, I�m confident Kiersa feels the same way I do.

 love mom, despite all, for her liveliness, her unconditional love, her spiritedness, her sense of style, her tacos, her eccentricities, her way with children, her wild stories and way of relaying information from the TV and other sources. I love mom always, and I am proud to be her daughter.

ophia loves grandma so, so much, they've spent a lot of time together, and have bonded during that time. Mom has taught Sophie lots of things, like to tell the twins, or anyone really, to "repent" when they are being naughty, or all those rhymes mom taught us growing up, e.g. "green, green, you're a queen, red, red you're dead", etc...
Sophia loves to be with grandma, sometimes even more than with her mom, and mom had been really great with Sophie which is a great help to me.

appy Mother's Day mom! So if I had to say one of my favorite things that we have done, it was all the fishing trips up at Lost Creek Lake! Those were some of the best times of my life and I am glad that you were the one that had taken me up there. All those hot summer days up at the intake tower and at Stewart Park were so much fun. I remember you always sitting up in the motorhome reading your books and watching us fish even though you never understood why. And your favorite, putting your feet into the water while we swam in the freezing water. We should do it again soon. I love you Mom and I hope your Mother's Day goes well. HAVE A HOT ONE!

om has this thing where no matter what it is she knows what�s wrong with you when you are sick and how to cure you!! Just the other week Canyon had a headache and she said that the next day he would have a cough and be very sick and he was! And she knows how to get to every single thrift store in the Rouge Valley with her eyes closed!! But you have to watch out! If you�re not good she will turn you into a lizard, dingbat, three hungry snakes, or something else very random and disturbing!

ne memory of you that will always stand out in my mind is when you had your aneurysm.  I went to see you at the hospital. You were still in intensive care. I went in and you had tubes sticking in your ears, half your head was shaved. It was a scary image. You were barley conscious. I looked at you. I was so scared. I think I held your hand. After a bit you mumbled three words to me, I love you. It made me cry really hard. That's all you said to me. I don't even know if you were conscious. I think Dad told me as I went in you weren't but I don't remember very well. I love you too Mom. Even though I might get mad sometimes, I really do love you. Thank you for raising me well and teaching me how to be me. I will always love you. I promise I will try harder to make it easier for you. Mom, I Love You, so much!<br> <br>
Love, Number 10
