<b>KAYLYNN</b><br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Kaylynn is having a ball in soccer! She has found another thing she excels 
in. Got on the team only after being pressured by her friends to do it and 
really is a team player.  Gets knocked around a bit, but takes it all in 
stride. Academically she is top of the class once again, as is Ammon.  She 
enjoys spending extra time with Kevin and other friends. Drawing, music, 
reading, and anything feminine is her cup of tea.
