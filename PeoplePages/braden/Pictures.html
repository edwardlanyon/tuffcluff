<b>BRADEN</b><br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Braden is the Babe Magnet!!  He has high school girls in tears because they 
are too old for him!  Girls constantly show up at the door asking if Braden 
can come out and explore in the forest with them! Seriously!  That is what 
they ask!!  He loves being in 6th grade and all the different classes.  Shop 
and P.E. are his favorites.  He enjoys going for bike rides and Nintendo and 
especially drums!!
