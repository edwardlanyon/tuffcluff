<b>DAKOTA</b><br>
<br>
<b>Winter 2005</b> Dakota has been keeping busy with karate and design technology club. He's also developed a new obsession with magnets and has been building all kinds of elaborate sculptures and geometric designs with magnetic rods and spheres. But his biggest achievement is that after 5 years he has finally managed to beat Edward at chess! A feat that earned him ï¿½5.<br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Dakota is enjoying the local village school here in Kent. He makes friends easily and has a reputation for being the class clown. He has a passion for archery and makes bows from sticks in our hedge for the all neighborhood children. The hedge is dying! If he had his way Dakota would live on nothing but <a href='../../cafe/recipes/cluffin.html'>Egg McCluffins</a> and sour gummy worms.<br>
<br>
<b>Spring 2004</b> Dakota has always been an energetic, athletic and outdoorsy child. He loves football (American and British), rugby, swimming, camping, skiing, exploring, climbing and rafting. But Dakota has a gentler side as well. He also enjoys the theater, museums and classic films. <br>
