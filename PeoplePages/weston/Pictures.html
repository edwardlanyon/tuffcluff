<img src="Pictures/wesbb.jpg" align=left><b>Twin Boys: the Definition of Destruction (1995)</b><br>
My twin brothers are absolute terrors! They can destroy the house in a matter of minutes and they're only three years old. When everything is quiet, something is being destroyed. One day when it was quiet, my mom went to search for the twins to stop them from demolishing something, but she had a hard time finding them because they were outside. She finally found them in the barn using her canning jars for grenades. They had broken about thirty jars, so in her rage, my mom spanked them and locked them in their room. After only a few minutes, my mom felt like she should apologized to them, so she unlocked their room and went in. The twins were gone, the window was open, and the screen was missing. They had jumped out the window (a six foot drop) to escape their imprisonment. While my mom searphed for them from the window, they were creating more havoc. In a matter of minutes they had jumped in the hot tub with all their clothes on, ran around in the dirt, then tracked mud in the living room and sat on the freshly shampooed furniture. What happened after that is too exhausting to repeat. I just feel sorry for anyone who finds out they're expecting twin boys.

<img src='Pictures/weskir.jpg' align=left><b>Spring 2003</b><br>
I'm a boy. I'm 11 years old, 5'2" and 110 lbs. I am a twin. My twin, Dallas, was born 2 minutes before me and he is a boy too. I also have 5 sisters and 5 brothers, counting me. My hobbies are wake-boarding, football, biking and fishing. The biggest fish I ever caught was 18 ï¿½ inches. I played football for my school and my team was undefeated. No one scored a point on us until we went to finals in Santa Clara, CA. My favorite color is blue and I love cooking and devilled eggs. I am in 5th grade and my teacher is Mrs. Murphy. I am the 11th generation of the Cluff family in America. When I grow up I want to be a professional football player.<br>
