<b>CANYON</b><br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Waz up G? is his favorite thing to ask you (complete with the hand 
sign of the 2 middle fingers crossed).  Favorite song is 'Miss You' by Blink 182 
which he can recite to you perfectly. What a trip!  He is learning the U.S. 
states. Now he can name 27 of them by the shape and where they are on the 
map. He loves all animals, loves story time, likes to play with his toys and 
play in the garden. He LOVES his dad and lives for the time when dad comes 
home. His favorite friends live a few houses down and he goes there every day 
to play. He is a good boy and asks some great questions. A fun, fun job to 
raise him.
