<img src="Pictures/dennis1.jpg" align=left><img src="Pictures/dennis7.jpg" align=right>I was born August 4 1939 in Los Angeles (amongst the masses of people) and raised in Mesa, Arizona (amongst the masses of cactus). As a kid I preferred to pick mulberries and shoot insulators off telephone poles with my 'beenie flipper' than go to primary or school. I only wore shoes to church on Sunday, and boy did they hurt. Because I lived when dinosaurs roamed the earth, we didn't have a lot of modern conveniences. We used to have an icebox, to which a deliveryman brought a 50-pound chunk of ice each week. We had a butane hot-plate which held a tea kettle that was our 'water heater'. We took a bath on Saturday night in a #10 tub on the kitchen floor. Mom would pour the tea kettle into the tub (which heated the bottom of the tub only) and then put a bucket of cold water in on top of it. Stepping in to the bath, I'd always burn the soles of my feet yet, somehow, freeze to death at the same time. It was my eternal torture chamber. Every week was the same. All week long I'd play and have fun (till my heels and elbows were as black as sin) then come Saturday night Mom would take a wire brush, sand paper or a rasp and commence to tear all my skin off. That I survived to become an adult is a miracle. Grade School, High School, College at Arizona State University and then off to Norway on a Mission. I then moved to Ashland, Oregon where I briefly attended Southern Oregon University. It was there that I met, wooed and married the beautiful Diana George and off we went to the University of Southern California. Bart and Dane were born in LA and then we moved down to San Diego where Melanie, Natasha and Daisha were born. I worked in the Supermarket business, which eventually took us back to Ashland. It was there that Tiana and Shira were born. We briefly moved back to California, where Nial was born, then back again to Ashland where the twins, Dallas and Weston, were born.

<img align=left border=2 src=Pictures/momdad.jpg><a class=times70>A</a>As I lay in my bed at night in my teen years, I would dream of the unknown man I would marry. In my mind I would always see the distant shot of a man in a dark dress suit. At seventeen I saw you at church just returning from your mission to Norway. You were dressed in a dark suit, smiling and shaking everyone's hand. I thought after meeting you, is this the man I will marry? 
<br><br>
Near the end of my seventeen-year, I received through the spirit, a powerful witness of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when I read the Book of Mormon. When the Holy Ghost witnesses to you, you never forget it. That is why the missionaries live clean and close to the spirit, so they can have the spirit witness the truth of the gospel to the people when they explain the plan of happiness. After receiving my testimony, I knew who I was, what my life was all about, what I should be doing and where I would be after this life. 
<br><br>
Three months later I turned eighteen and you gave me a personal showing of your Norway mission slides. I had watched the slides at a fireside a year before. Now as I watched the land where my Great Grandmother Emma had come from in Oslo Norway, the spirit once again gave me a powerful witness that you were the right man for me to marry. I was shocked.  I was already engaged to a man on a mission to the Indians in the Southwest.  I was planning to attend BYU in the fall. 
<br><br>
In exactly one month we will be married 44 years. I can see the wisdom of the spirit, in telling me to marry you. I have grown the best in my life with the example of living with a man so valiant as you have been. 
<br><br>
The first help you gave me was your spiritual strength. This was my number one requirement for the man I was to marry. I felt if a man were spiritual enough to be obedient to the ways of the Lord, he would be good in all areas of life. You hold the priesthood, which is the greatest power on Earth. You blessed the children with the priesthood each year when they started school, when they were sick, in trouble, or at the time of their marriage. You have leaded us to kneel and pray twice each day as a family and as a couple.  We have read our scriptures daily, had home evening and vacations together. Weekly we have attended church to worship and to receive instruction for our daily life. You have blessed others when they needed help of some kind. I have seen miracles with our children, others and myself. You have been able to sacrifice giving up being with the boys or games on Saturdays to be with your family. 
<br><br>
Our five daughters have received great honors in their Universities and community with grades, music, art, photography, writing and other things. Dane was the first Eagle Scout in Oregon for his age. Dane and Nial have been heroes for saving people or buildings in floods, fire, and bringing others back to the fold. Our twins constantly service the people in our community with moving, cleanup, and missionary work.  Nial is an Eagle Scout and the twins will be soon.  Dane served a two-year mission to Germany, the home of my Great Grandfather. Our children out of the home have chosen to sacrifice and enrich their personal lives by living truth, becoming parents and committing to their partners. 
<br><br> 
You used your priesthood power when our creek flooded and our home was in danger. As we knelt in prayer with your priesthood power, you turned the creek back to its bed within the hour. Jesus used this same power to create this Earth, heal the sick, raise the dead, and stop the storms at sea. I am so glad for a man who has qualified for the priesthood that has been restored. Who believed the Church of Jesus Christ is the true church Jesus gave us when he was on Earth.  Then because the authority was lost when the priesthood wasnï¿½t pass on by the apostles, the gospel was taken back to heaven and restored in 1830 through the prophet Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith is a descendant of Joseph of Egypt and is spoken of in the Bible to do the great work of the restoration in the last days, which he did in 1830. You joined the church as a child and have stayed faithful to it all your life. When you look at the majority of people in this world that don't know or accept these facts you are rare and blessed for having this truth to guide your life here and your life to come. 
<br><br>
I am glad for a man who constantly repents of his sins and remains a defender of the faith as his fathers before him. The world teaches to be your own self, not make long term commitments, don't listen to or obey your parents or the prophets, don't take time to go to church or serve others, sin it up without feeling bad about it, cheat, steal, lie, abuse your body with addictive slavery vices of drinking smoking etc. It teaches you to mar your body with paint or holes, to be on a power trip, to be greedy, to forget your family because you are the only thing that is important, to not to forgive others and many other teachings that never will work out. You have learned and live the truth of many things. Happiness and peace are the result. 
<br><br>
Thank you dear for all the great work you have done in the kingdom of God on the earth. You have been a great leader in the church for over thirty years and remain a great worker in all the callings you receive in the church. You have taught me to be my best in my church work and how to perform my greatest church calling, a visiting teacher, done on the first of each month. You have taught me how to seek out my ancestors and made it possible for us to perform their temple work. 
<br><br>
You took me to the temple each week when we lived by a temple and continue to do so. This is my favorite place besides our home and our children's homes. You were willing to have a big family and have provided for them when this was my desire. You pay our tithing and we have had the windows of heaven open and have more than we can contain of temporal things. 
<br><br>
I love that you are a man and do things like a man; in speech, actions and dress. Just being a man, today is a great thing. You are a great shot with a gun. Thanks for always making a living, and not making me work and be a slave to boys-toys and wants. Because of you I have been able to accomplish our goal of having and raising a large family. 
<br><br>
Your great health has been inspiring to me. I have been helped with mine by garden food that you grow and many daily walks we have shared. You are extra strong in manpower and have shocked many men with your strength. You were the wrestler that was never pinned in high school. You have always been very smart in business, school, relationships and everything else. I love how people admire you and that you have so many friends that love you. You have learned so many things; how to keep bees, write love poems, gardening, car and house repair, building things, working with steel, leather work, painting, etc.  You ran the large areas of San Diego and LA in business and ran half of San Diego in the Seminary program. Your have a great sense of humor and are fun to be around. 
<br><br>
You are the answer to my prayers and I love you so very much. Happy Birthday. I have had a great life with you. I am extra glad we married for eternity in the house of the Lord, now that life is almost over for us. We will be together forever, have our children and gain our exaltation when we leave this Earth. 
<br>
<br>
Yours forever, 
<br>
Diana

<img border=2 align=left src=../../Pictures/dane.jpg><a class=times70>I</a>

remember wondering if I would ever be able to walk as fast as Dad

<br><br>
Iï¿½ve worked since I was 11 and in those 30 years, over half of the time I have been able to work with my Dad.

<br><br>
I got the Chevy Vega stuck in the mud at the bottom of Tolman Creek Rd. and after an hour or two of thinking about all of the lectures I would receive I had to finally swallow my pride and call on Dad for help. He taught me a lasting lesson on how less is more by arriving, silently pulling me out with his truck and then saying only two words which spoke volumes when he said ï¿½thatï¿½s one". I never wanted to get a two.

<br><br>
I was with Dad the day he ran out of fuel in the ultra light. He plunged to the earth from about 150 feet high, narrowly missing a hangar. My stomach knotted up as I watched him disappear from view and Iï¿½m sure I could have beaten Moms high school track speed records as I ran to Dad. He sat motionless against a gate post in the totaled plane. I knew he must be superman when he climbed out of the wreckage. Quietly though, I learned my first real lesson about the effects of pride on a human being as Dad struggled with the embarrassment of the situation. Dad taught me how to teach correct principles through example.

<br><br>
Dad and I used to go out in the undeveloped acreage behind our home on strawberry lane in Spring Valley California. We walked on a large water pipe and I marveled at the angle of his feet as we balanced. We shot his 22 rifle into a hillside then dug out the bullets to see what they looked like. We flew a box kite to the end of two or three spools of string. The string sagged almost to the ground and when it broke, we watched it disappear over freeways and beyond.

<br><br>
Dad ate the birthday cake I baked for him when I was 7 even though I inadvertently put in something like 2 cups of salt and a teaspoon of sugar.

<br><br>
Dad always made sure I had a dog. Smokey and I played hide and seek. Tonka and I dug for China with the turtle. But Menven and I were the greatest of friends and when he got rabies and Dad had to use the 22 to put him down, Dad cried with me at the loss of our good friend.

<br><br>
Dad is pretty busy most of the year, but Christmas presents are a big deal to Dad. We were always loaded.

<br><br>
I havenï¿½t achieved many of the things Dad tried so hard to encourage me to become but each time Dad and I meet, and I look into his eyes, I know he loves me with all of his heart and that unconditional love from my parents is what has made me all that I am that is good.

<br><br>
Sometimes when I am with Mom and Dad I have been able to see them with a certain twinkle in their eyes for each other, a look which transcends all of the earthly trials they endure, and I glimpse eternity.

<br><br>
Growing up, I never saw anyone beat Dad at arm wrestling.

<br><br>
Dad is the reason I have the work ethic that I do.

<br><br>
When Dad and I are together, we donï¿½t talk much. But, our bond speaks volumes.

<br><br>
Once I tried to sneak in after hours by shutting off the lights and the engine and coasting in from the Indian.  I closed the car door softly and headed for the shack in the back. Suddenly Dads voice came softly from behind me, on the other side of the car by the barn. He was out in his robe tending to chores that parents wake up to in the night and I was caught. I endured lecture #86. Fortunately I lived at home in the days of the early lectures, numbering less than 100 at the time.

<br><br>
I once had a bicycle race with Dad. We came down a steep hill and turned onto our street and I was in the lead. I think he probably let me pull ahead but as I looked back to assess my advantage, I strayed to the side of the street and ran directly into the back of a parked pickup truck. My bike stuck in the bumper and I flew over the bed and smashed into the cab.  I could feel the blood running down my legs as Dad picked me up out of the back of the truck and carried me back home. We found no blood after all but ouch.

<br><br>
I loved to be with Dad, especially when he was working. One day when I was about six I was playing with a friend and I persuaded him to go with me up behind our house to watch my Dad work on his beehives. As we approached the house, my friend trailed me a few steps back but Dad was nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the bees began to swarm. I yelled for my friend to run but I couldnï¿½t escape. The bees began to sting me everywhere. I plugged my ears, closed my mouth and squeezed a bee out of my nose. When I could, I would scream for help as I stomped and shook and inched my way toward the house. Soon Dad heard my pleas and rushed up the hill grabbing me and carrying me to safety. Mom and Dad scraped about forty stingers from my body. I swelled up like a balloon and spent a few days out of school.

<br><br> 
If you ever want a favor from Dad, you just bring him a large bag of peanut M&Ms.

<br><br>
Dad has a passion for astronomy which he often shares with you at 2am on a winter morning when some event in the night sky is occurring.

<br><br>
Dad started taking me golfing with him when I was old enough to hang on to the bag and ride along. When I was a teen he would open my door at o'darkthirty on a summer morning and persuade me to play at least six holes at oak knoll before the place was open for business.

hen I think of Grandpa I think of a man who loves seeing his grandkids. Every time he sees us grandkids he ALWAYS acts likes it the last time he's gonna see us whenever we are leaving his house. Also when I think of Grandpa I think of his prayers. He always says the most perfect prayers. He always starts out saying good morning, or good evening, or whatever time of day it is. I have always loved that about him. He loves taking the family on vacations and spending time just watching everyone have fun. Another thing is that he falls asleep no matter what the occasion is. Church, family reunions, movies, scriptures at night, anything where he's sitting down and grandma is talking... :)  This summer living with him has been a cool thing as well. When Grandma was gone in Idaho for a funeral, Grandpa made the BEST FOOD!!!!!!!! He made spaghetti and meatballs the first night and then he bought the biggest artichokes I have ever seen and he bought lots of ice cream and made tons of fantastic soup. And when I was having a bad day at work I would come home and he would tell me that it's my choice to like my job and have fun or to dislike it and be miserable everyday. I love his advice he gives me and look forward to lots more of it. I love you Grandpa! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!

ad has affected my life in so many ways. He was the first Home Teaching companion I had after receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood. I remember we visited Joe Smith, who was struggling at the time. It was not long before Joe was our Gospel Doctrine teacher, and doing very well. I am confident that the love, understanding, and correct teachings expressed by Dad had their intended effect.
<br><br>
It was Dad who encouraged Melanie and I to make the sacrifices necessary to complete graduate school. Following his wise counsel has made all the difference in our lives. He has been a consistent, loving example and has always been interested in us as a family and as individuals. It was Dad who purchased for Melanie her first camera. She has blossomed into a great photographer and has blessed the lives of so many people with her talents. Thank you, Dad, for being an inspired father and spiritual leader. We love you.

<br><br>
<li>When I was younger (and even now) he would always grab me in a bear hug and tickle me until I thought I would burst.</li>

<br><br>
<li>He  always sends me these emails that just make my day; telling me that I am a great kid and other things that make me want to just give him a  huge bear hug.</li>

<br><br>
<li>Whenever we visit he is always fun and cheerful and tells stories and everything just to make our visit more enjoyable.</li>

<br><br>
<li>He is a person Iï¿½ve always looked up to; he is a great spiritual influence and to have faith like he does is a goal for me.</li>

<br><br>
<li>He was always there whenever I needed something to help me out one of his emails would arrive or a letter or he would call on the phone and now even with Skype.</li>

<li>Hearing dad call my name, looking for me. I was naked up in a citrus tree hiding (I must have been 3) </li>
<br><br>
<li>When we moved to Oregon and Melanie got really sick on the trip and Dad had to give her a blessing.</li>
<br><br> 
<li>I remember Dad giving blessings to aunt Kathleen. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Dad set up my folding lawn chair in the new house while people were working on helping us move in. I was so tired and it seemed like it was the middle of the night and the afghan I was using had too many holes and wasnï¿½t warm. Dad gave me a hug in between loads. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Dad dug a huge hole in the backyard so we could roast a pig for a family get together. The hole was really deep and I didnï¿½t understand how it could cook on rocks. It was so good. </li>
<br><br>
<li>"Get me a 2X4!" Dad had found raccoons in the tree above the driveway and they were toast. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Working with Dad in the shop airing up tires when he worked for Hassells </li>
<br><br>
<li>The gunshot echoed around the barn and we all saw the truck lifting Mr. Steak. Daish loved the whole thing, but it made me sick (just like the rabbits and the chickens). </li>
<br><br>
<li>Planting the fruit trees in the orchard ï¿½ there was one for each kid (mine was a peach tree) </li>
<br><br>
<li>Planting the pine tree in the yard; then Dane jumped right over it </li>
<br><br>
<li>Putting up Christmas lights on the orchard so they spelled greetings you could read from the street</li> 
<br><br>
<li>Getting busted for shooting bb guns at my sisters </li>
<br><br>
<li>Listening to dad tell stories at bed time ï¿½ Brer Rabbit was my favorite because he was so sneaky and could always get away with everything ï¿½ and dad would really get into the characters, changing his voice and manners and even screwing up his eyes (still gross) </li>
<br><br>
<li>Working with dad in the shop in the barn. Dad showed me how to use the torch, lathe and a little welding. I remember laughing at black boogers and starting the fire in the home-made wood stove because it was so cold. </li>
<br><br>
<li>All the animals; the ponies, rabbits, worms, chickens, goats, cats, lovebirds, cows were all dadï¿½s idea. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Dad would sometimes pick me up at high school just to have lunch. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Long talks about choices and consequences in the car </li>
<br><br>
<li>Someone who would help me no matter what </li>
<br><br>
<li>Without Dadï¿½s teasing, dares and encouragement, I probably never would have gone to graduate school </li>
<br><br>
<li>Going camping with relatives at Lost Lake and trying to name all the constellations you knew (Dad seemed to know them all) </li>
<br><br>
<li>Dadï¿½s talks in church were always really good. They also always had football references; funny, since I never remembered him ever watching a single Sunday football gameï¿½not ever</li>

always thought Dad was the strongest man in the world. He could squeeze a scale to max with his bare hands, drive a full size nail into a 2x4 in one hammer stroke and, most shockingly of all, open a rusty barn canning jar lid without even breaking a sweat! Tiana and I took to calling him ï¿½Creda Hulkï¿½ after witnessing countless examples of his superhuman strength. I never lost a ï¿½my-dad-is-stronger-than-your-dadï¿½ fight on the playground in my life. I mean, whatï¿½s any kid gonna come back with after hearing how your Dad started a forest fire when he stubbed his toe on a rock?! Tough as nails, my Dad! But I was set for life once they heard the one about the skill-saw that sank so deep into Dadï¿½s arm that it ground to a complete halt, yet he continued working until someone pointed out the spurting blood. No one could ever top that! But then Dad got older and I got older, and I began to see things differently. Eventually I had to admit that Iï¿½d been wrong about Dad all along; he wasnï¿½t the strongest man in the world ï¿½ he was the strongest man in the universe! It may take a lot of strength to open a barn jar but itï¿½s Dadï¿½s incredible strength of character that really makes him Mr. Universe to me.
<br><br>
There are three things about Dadï¿½s character that I absolutely bow down to; he is a phenomenal family man, he has an infectious zest for life and he is profoundly kind.
<br><br>
Family Man: Dad is a man for whom family truly does come first. Everything he does is for his family. He puts in overtime at work or church then comes home to put in overtime with the family too. Heï¿½s shelved most of his hobbies and dreams to instead focus on the hobbies and dreams of his children. He always found fun ways to connect with his kids whether it was reading bedtime stories, playing putt-putt cars, pointing out the stars, working the garden together or whipping up a special treat (homemade ice cream, whip-me-whop-me pudding, biscuits and gravy, salsa, etc). He was always willing to help us with our homework, he relished it! When it came time for family vacations he always went the extra mile to make them special. Who doesnï¿½t have fond memories of traveling the southwest in the old camper or motorhomes? 
<br>
He is an inspiring man who leads by example and does what was right whilst remaining approachable and down to earth. When I think of all the fathers out there who donï¿½t seem to care about their kids, or worse still, donï¿½t even see them, it really makes me appreciate the amount of time and energy Dad has put into each and every one of his children. Heï¿½s a real man.
<br>
If there were a category entitled ï¿½Dadï¿½s Greatest Hitsï¿½ Iï¿½d have to include the grilling of our dates! What would happen was the poor, unsuspecting fellow would show up at our door and be greeted by big Daddy and his demand for a private chat. The boys were always terrified. What came next was Dadï¿½s infamous metaphorical car story. Heï¿½d say his daughter was a shiny new Lamborghini that he was reluctantly loaning to this less-than-worthy boy for the night and kept talking until the fear was palpable at which point heï¿½d close by saying that if his little Lamborghini came back with so much as a scratch, heï¿½d skin the boy alive! By the time it was over the boy was wetting himself and cursing the day he ever laid eyes on a Cluff girl. But it did the trick, I loved him for it and was funny to boot ï¿½ but only in RETROSPECT!  
<br><br>
Zest for Life: Iï¿½ve always admired Dadï¿½s fascination with the world. Heï¿½s a bee keeper, an amateur astronomer, a keen gardener, a farmer, an inventor, a woodworker, a mechanic, a speaker and the list goes onï¿½He loves museums, books, music, art ï¿½ everything! He just loves learning. And I think he wanted to pass that on because whatever slight fascination with something any of his children displayed, Dad was right there with a book or a membership or a bug bag or a camera or a goat for heavenï¿½s sake! The man has always championed and fostered his childrenï¿½s interests. For me that meant things ranging from entomology to cheerleading and everything in between. He bought me a bug bag with a killing jar, an Audubon field guide, magnifying glasses, pins, the whole nine yards. He even got me into bug 4H. Most Dads would just tell their daughter to not touch the icky spider. In cheerleading he was constantly making suggestion that really helped and even made us a wooden box to hold our signs ï¿½ it was still in use when I graduated. From chickens to the stars, you name it ï¿½ if we were interested, Dad was interested. 
<br>
Dad always went out of his way to make holidays magical for us. On Christmas eve, when he was sure we were all tucked up in bed heï¿½d ring the sleigh bells and stomp on the roof calling out, ï¿½ho, ho, ho!ï¿½ I canï¿½t tell you how that made our hearts race with excitement. Iï¿½ll never forget the Christmas when he made all of our gifts in the woodshop. I loved the doll house! On Halloween Dad was our chauffeur, shuttling us around to neighborhoods with the richest pickings for trick-or-treaters. Dad never needed to wear a costume on Halloween because his crazy-one-eyed-monster look was enough. Itï¿½s my favorite! One Easter it snowed and he woke us all up and told us to look outside at the Easter bunny tracks leading away from the house. He must've used a rabbit from the barn, but heï¿½d never admit it! 
<br>
Even doing something as mundane as watching TV with Dad was fun because heï¿½d get such a kick out of shows like Ma and Pa Kettle, The Honeymooners, Laurel and Hardy or Bill Cosby. Heï¿½d laugh until heï¿½d wheeze and eventually have a coughing fit. Sometimes heï¿½d yell ï¿½thatï¿½s true!ï¿½ or ï¿½right!ï¿½ or ï¿½yes!ï¿½ He just had so much fun! Dad was always tickled by little things that weï¿½d say. Iï¿½d only have to say, ï¿½duh, Dad!ï¿½ to have him rolling in the aisles. He also really got a kick out of little things like pretending to hate green olives or naming his chest hairs! Iï¿½d ask him what a specific hairï¿½s name was and heï¿½d say Zacharius or Benoni or Ichabod, then Iï¿½d carefully remember the location of that hair which Iï¿½d go back to after asking the names of several others and heï¿½d always get it wrong and Iï¿½d call him on it! He loved it.
<br>
I thought Dad was suave because he spoke a foreign language and clever because he was a college graduate but the thing that made him cool was his willingness to try new things. Heï¿½ll try ANYTHING once! I warned him that marmite (a yeast extract by-product) was the dark, sticky cousin of Satan, but he tried it anyway ï¿½ twice! And fresh ground ginger? It knocked him to the floor but he tried it! And he keeps trying things. I love that.
<br>
Dadï¿½s stories had a profound influence on me because, as Edward always says, ï¿½Iï¿½m all about the storyï¿½. Brer Rabbit was fantastic but what I really loved were the tales from his Arizona childhood. I distinctly remember feeling like my childhood was really crud compared to his and that Iï¿½d better create more adventures for myself or I would have nothing to tell my own kids! I do tell my kids my childhood stories now but despite my best efforts they still lack the power and drama of Dadï¿½s shoeless adventures in the desert.
<br><br>
Kindness: Dad has the biggest heart. He never has a bad word to say about anyone. You could fill a library with the names of people that heï¿½s helped. Heï¿½s honest, full of integrity and above all, kind. Not just kind in an ordinary way ï¿½ he practices the turn-the-other-cheek type of kindness, the shirt-off-his-back type of kindness, the be-there-for-you-no-matter-what type of kindness. Heï¿½s a rock you can rely on. Heï¿½s so kind that itï¿½s been a bit hard for him to be successful in the business world. He just doesnï¿½t have that cold, merciless thing in him, and I really admire that. When it comes to the things that really matter ï¿½ heï¿½s the most successful man I know!
<br><br>
Nowadays Dad is slowing down and limping a little, and a lot of people would say that that is just old age, but I know better, itï¿½s because heï¿½s hauling around a spirit the size of a giant redwood! That's why he's the strongest man in the universe! And he is my hero.

was really glad when Daisha mentioned this project to me, because I've been meaning to complain about you for some time. To be frank, having you as the benchmark against which I'm judged as a man, husband and father is just bloody annoying. Any man who can stand by calmly whilst his wife wallpapers not just one, but both of his vulgar over-sized American fridges, is really not setting a good example to his daughters of the reasonable degree of common sense a husband should attempt to impose in such a situation, and is therefore clearly not the kind of father-in-law that one wants to have to live up to. Your insistence on being so stinking perfect all the time has caused me no end of grief and I want to make an impassioned plea that you do the decent thing and set out to acquire some kind of vice, or at least commit some act of gross negligence, or disgraceful marital dis-obedience as soon as can be arranged. 
<br><Br>
As a man who has married into the family I have joined a rather exclusive club of men struggling to maintain the unrealistically high levels of happiness that you have unwisely led our wives to expect. Some of us have been driven to repeatedly attend gaudy Christmas light displays, watch "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" on a weekly basis, or, most humiliatingly of all, sell pink exfoliating creams in order to keep our wives content. You sir, are the primary cause of our emasculation!
<br><BR>
Nevertheless, I do feel that I do owe you a certain debt of gratitude. I believe I am unique amongst your son-in-laws in being spared not only the Lamborghini talk and the horse talk, but also the "special" pre-marital talk (I've asked all the other's what's in that one, but they all just avoid eye-contact, cross their legs, and clam-up) and I suppose you did let me marry your favourite daughter, so you can't be all that bad.
<br><Br> 

There's a lot of gushy American talk about loving you on this page, quite rightly I suppose, as we all do, but I'm far too British to ever say that outright. I suspect that it's human nature for us all to have an innate love and respect for our parents (and in-laws) due to their position (and incomprehensible age!). I've always felt myself particularly lucky with my own parents, however, because their nature and behaviour command far greater respect and admiration than their position alone affords them. This is unquestionably also true of yourself, you are not only a father-in-law, but a man whom one is proud to have as a father-in-law and I look forward to the day, as I begin to reach an incomprehensible age, and the suitors begin to gather around Tabitha, when you can take me aside and fully brief me on how to extract the full power of the Lamborghini guilt trip (though it'll have to be an Aston Martin.... the best thing you can do to a Lamborghini is scratch it).

remember Grandpa by his loving of walnuts. I would always go out to collect them for him in the season. It was really fun because he used to pay me for each one. Grandpa is also great because he always writes me really nice emails. He's fun, he cares about people and he's the best grandpa in the world!

reda Hulk aka Dennis Cluff aka Tianaï¿½s Superhero

<br><br>
I donï¿½t know that thereï¿½s any girl out there whoï¿½s wrapped tighter around their dadï¿½s finger than I am. As long as I can remember, Iï¿½ve been a Daddyï¿½s girl. Itï¿½s always made me proud for someone to tell me that I look like him or act like him. I canï¿½t imagine that anyone can love their dad more than I love mine.

<br><br>
Dad and I share some similar weaknesses, food being one of themï¿½namely ice cream. When Dad worked at the Airport in Medford while I was little, I remember stopping at his office with him only to find it was locked and he didnï¿½t have the keys. He really needed to get in, so he told me heï¿½d buy me an ice cream cone if I could fit my arm through the mail slot in the door and unlock it. I tried soooo hard, but couldnï¿½t do it. After going somewhere with Dad, heï¿½d often end the outing with a trip to an ï¿½undisclosed locationï¿½ to get an ï¿½undisclosed treatï¿½ (all you siblings of mine know what Iï¿½m talking about), with the condition that I had to finish it before we got home. What a guy!! That was so fun!! Iï¿½ll never forget that, and Iï¿½ll probably pass on the tradition. 

<br><br>
Speaking of food, I unfortunately did not inherit Dadï¿½s talent of cooking (funny, since I was a Home Economics teacher). Dad is the best cook I know! No one on earth can make biscuits and gravy like Dad. Try as they might, all replicas are pitiful, flavorless copycats at best in comparison to Dadï¿½s. I donï¿½t know his magical secret, but there must be one because if his children find out that theyï¿½ve missed out on biscuits and gravy, thereï¿½s weeping sure to be heard ï¿½round the globe.

<br><br>
When I was in 6th grade, grades meant squat to me, and my report cards reflected that. Dad convinced me I could get better grades and he told me that for every report card that had straight Aï¿½s, heï¿½d come pick me up from school and take me out to lunch. Do you think I ever got anything lower than an A- after that? No way! At least not the rest of middle school, and Iï¿½m pretty sure I never dipped below a B in high school. I remember that when Iï¿½d get a message from the office telling me my Dad was waiting for me, it was the most thrilling feeling! Heï¿½d apologize for his grubby work overalls and dirty shop look, but I didnï¿½t care. I was so proud to walk out and go to lunch with him. He was my hero and he couldnï¿½t have looked more handsome to me. 

<br><br>
Dad has always been my greatest source of inspiration. Iï¿½ve always looked up to him more than anyone else I can think of. Heï¿½s the reason I always wanted to be good. Okay, so I admit Iï¿½m a chicken and Iï¿½m terrified of doing something wrong lest I face punishment or lecture, but the worst punishment for me is to know that Iï¿½ve disappointed Dad or hurt him in any way. I have lived my life in such a way that I would NEVER have to look at Dad and (no matter what he looks like on the outside) know that deep inside him he holds a little disappointment toward me. I made some mistakes, but I was quick to turn around when I thought of what Dad must think of me. I canï¿½t feel like I have a good, happy life if I know that Iï¿½m hurting dad. Heï¿½s the reason I was too afraid to skip school, or get bad grades, or stop going to church, or not finish college, or anything else that he might feel a little let down about. He means the world to me!

<br><br>
Every day after school, the first thing I wanted to do was stop and say hi to dad at the shop and then work with him for a little while so I could get some daddy/daughter time in. My first job was working on a torch in the shop so I could work around dad. I remember Saturday mornings were not mornings to sleep in for me when I was a teen. They were mornings I would jump up early and go work in the yard with Dad. One particular morning it was foggy, and I could hear dad cutting trees out in the yard, so I got up, groggy and all, and went out to work with him because I loved working in the yard or garden with him more than anything. To this day, working in the yard is my very most favorite ï¿½choreï¿½, even though itï¿½s more of a reward to me. I loved hearing dad explain where everything was planted in the garden, and I loved making sure every weed was plucked.

<br><br>
Dad taught me how to shift a manual car smoothly. We would drive up and down Dead Indian so I could practice shifting until he couldnï¿½t feel the shifting transition.  He always had time for me.

<br><br>
Dad always understood me. He understood my need to do a job right, even if it took too long. He understood my love of animals (I probably got it from him). My dogs love Dad more than they love me!! Dad understood how to talk to me without getting me riled up. He always had a way of saying things just right. 

<br><br>
With all these warm fuzzy memories, I have to toss in a cold prickly, right? I remember when I was really young, I went outside without my shoes when Mom told me to wear them and Dad put me up on the platform in the castle bedroom and spanked my feet. I remember it hurting so bad, and feeling so mistreated. So guess what I grew up and did. I did the same thing to Talea, then I felt really bad because I remember how it felt to this day. Like father, like daughter, right? I love him anyway. I just have a great memory!!!

<br><br>
Dad had hands of leather and incredible strength. I watched Dad hammer a nail into a board in one swing of the hammer in a Pioneer Day nailing competition at a church party!! Weï¿½d run from his spankings only to be too slow and just end up catapulted down the hall by the momentum of the spank combined with the running. The back of the neck hair pulls were effective and memorable!

<br><br>
Dad loved Zamfir, and so did I, only because I knew Dad loved it. I have a distinct memory of driving on the back road to the Medford Airport and listening to it with him. (It was probably right before I tried to unlock his office door.) Daisha hated it more than anything, but I couldnï¿½t understand why. Dad liked it, why didnï¿½t she? Didnï¿½t everyone love everything Dad loved?

<br><br>
No one in the world can read a Brer Rabbit story like Dad can. My favorite thing before we went to bed was to sit in the hall between the bedrooms with Dad and lean on him while he read Brer Rabbit stories. They were so animated and fun with all the voices he used. Nothing compares to that. I always liked Dadï¿½s big belly because it made the best pillow while he read. 

<br><br>
Dad is one the most wrinkle-free, grey hair-free, 60 something males I know. I remember when I was 10, Daisha and I were sitting with Dad outside the church in Auburn and we were counting his gray hairs in his sideburns. He only had a few even though he was 47, and to this day he only has a few right at the sideburns area. 

<br><br>
Dad says ï¿½Barfï¿½ when he burps. Who else has such a creative Dad?  I guess Dane comes close by saying ï¿½Ralph.ï¿½ Barking spiders were a common infestation at our house, especially in the yard, if you know what I mean.

<br><br>
I love looking at stars with Dad, especially while weï¿½re camping. I was watching stars with him when he saw an explosion in the sky like a star blew up. He instilled in me a love for the sky and the stars and identifying the constellations. Maybe thatï¿½s why I was watching the sky when I saw the space shuttle that disintegrated over several states.

<br><br>
Dad gave me his good health. Weï¿½re rarely sick, but when we are, boy is it bad. I even got high blood sugar from him to the point that Iï¿½ve been warned by my doctor that Iï¿½ll be diabetic if I get to 175 pounds. Yep, we share everything. Well, almost everything. I donï¿½t have toenail fungus yet, knock on wood! Dane inherited that instead of me. Thanks, Dane!

<br><br>
Ever since I can remember, Iï¿½ve wanted to name my first son after Dad. I was scared to death when Melanie was toying with Dennis for Sorenï¿½s middle name. I wanted it for my son so badly!! I was so excited to have Hyatt and be able to surprise Dad with passing on his name. I hope Hyatt lives up to that name, because itï¿½s a great one.

<br><br>
I canï¿½t sum up what dad means to me in words because I can only feel it, not say it. Iï¿½m not very eloquent. Everyone loves Dad! Show me one person who dislikes Dad, and Iï¿½ll show you a low-down rotten piece of scum. He has 9 living kids, and not one of them dislikes him or harbors ill will toward him. That says a lot!!! Dad is my Hero. He always has been. I never wanted to grow up and leave him, but it had to happen, and lucky for me, I get to be pretty close and my husband loves him too. I had to marry someone just like him so I wouldnï¿½t cry all day long everyday about being away from him. Living in Utah was often a painful experience, mostly because I was so far from home. I donï¿½t think I could ever move farther away from Dad than I am right now. It would kill me. I LOVE YOU DADï¿½MORE THAN ALL THE STARS AND ALL THE SPECKS OF DUST ON EACH STAR!! Iï¿½ll always be your baby girl.

ho and what is a successful father and Husband? When I was graduating from high school, the newspaper asked me what my goals in life are. I let them know that I was planning to go on a mission, then go to college to get a degree in fire science and then go on to be a fire fighter. But then I told them that my biggest goal in life was to be a successful father and husband. Growing up in life I hadnï¿½t had much of an example. My dad left my mom and his children when I was 15 and the years before that werenï¿½t good to begin with. Finally when I was 16 I moved in with a family that I thought was the perfect family. I would watch them as they intermingled with each other, how they would wrestle and tease and dance in the living room. Well that was the life I wanted. I wanted to find that special someone that I could share my life with; someone I could dance with in the living room and wrestle with the kids on the floor. But how was I going to find that someone? The Lord has mysterious ways of working. I found her while I was driving semi. When I first met this girl, I could tell that she was someone special. I could tell that she had been raised well and loved her family, especially her Dad. That made me nervous and happy at the same time. Nervous, ï¿½cause now I had to live up to his expectations, especially after I got the talk about the Lamborghini and the VW. That was as bad as getting shown a gun, but I knew he loved her, at that time probably loved her more than I did, but my love was growing fast. It made me happy because as I got to know her dad, I knew he was a great man and that if I followed his example she would love me as much as she loves him. 
<br><br>
What is it that that she loves about him? She loves all the different ways he says ï¿½I love you.ï¿½ For example, the last time she told him ï¿½I love you,ï¿½ he said, ï¿½you are the center jewel in my crown,ï¿½ but to Tiana, that was ï¿½I love you.ï¿½  She trusts and believes everything he says. An example of her trust is when we were driving semi, she still thought that there was chicken soup in the silver transformers on the posts, and that Black Butte was the top of Mt. Shasta because her Dad had told her those things. The love and trust that she has for him is more than I have ever seen between a father and daughter. Those are big shoes to fill now though. I have gone for advice and walked away with a story about two horses pulling a cart; but through the years I am learning more and more about working together. I understand why she loves him so much. He loves his children, he loves his wife and he loves those who come into the family. He is kind to everyone, is someone you can talk to, and is someone that loves his Father in Heaven. Thank you, Dennis, for instilling all of your traits in my wife and your children. It seems the more I know my wife, the more I know you because she is so much like you.  I was proud to name my son after you, even if it meant stopping a name that has gone on for generations in my own family. I thank the Dennis and Diana team for pulling the cart that has gone to what it is today. Thank you for showing my wife the secrets, and how if she lives the gospel and loves her Father in Heaven, that that is the most important thing. I love you DAD, and thank you everyday for the life you have given me. You are my idea of a successful father and husband. I Love You!

ne of my memories of Dad is on Halloween, I must have been between 5 and 8. Mom had set up the dinner table to look like a hobo dinner, complete with a tin can to drink out of, candlelight and a piece of candy wrapped in a miniature handkerchief, tied around a stick. So the mood was already a little bit scary for a little kid, like I was. But as we were eating dad (who was dressed up as Egor, or some kind of creature) started to convulse and drool, making horrible moans and groans. Everyone seemed to think it was hilarious, but I was completely freaked out and started to cry, as I was so convinced by Dad's monster-act.

<br><br>
Things I like best about DAD:
<br><br>
<li>Biscuits and Gravy</li>
<br><br>
<li>Yabba Dabba Do!</li>
<br><br>
<li>The Garden</li>
<br><br>
<li>Brer Rabbit stories</li>

He has always been there for me. Dad is the reason that I am what I am now. He is my role model. I just want to say thanks for everything you do for me even if it doesn't look like I am grateful.

ere are some of the things of you that stand out in my mind while I was and am growing up in your house, from earliest to most recent.

<br><br>
I think some of my earliest memories of growing up were of Weston and me playing (barefoot) in the steel bin. We used to throw things at each other and then you would pull us out and tell us to stop, just to come out 5 minutes later and find us doing it again. Another is we used to jump off the roof of the house into the hot tub and hope we didn't hit the benches. (maybe that's why we had to replace the roof in that area) 

<br><br>
I have got to say that the earliest thing I remember is the shop and playing in it, I remember how you used to throw tow dollies in each hand onto the table and then you would paint them and Weston and I would put on the tires, I was always amazed by how you would reach into your small bucket and always pull out the right amount of nuts. We used to play hide and go seek in the tires and throw them around. 

<br><br>
I remember the one time you were working in the barn in the wood shop and we were having scriptures and prayers and you didn't show up so we went on without you and then the next day you were in bed and told us that last night the big belt sander got caught in your leg and you were whistling and whistling but no one came so you had to take it apart by yourself. 
That reminds me, whenever I was at the neighbors you would whistle and they would all know what it meant and tell us to go home. That has got to be your trademark, lots of people do it but you do it all the time and the whole family knows what it means. 

<br><br>
I remember your Brer Rabbit stories, they were so interesting and funny. I remember when I was in 5th and 6th grade and I would bring home homework and do it at like 10:00 and you would help me but I would be so tired and you would be trying to explain a college level math to me and I would be so lost and just nod. Then the garden, you are so good at gardening and I didn't know a thing so you would tell me to get a tool and I would have no idea what it was and when it was time to trim the trees, you would have it all mapped out in your mind of how it would look next year and I would again have no idea. Well I guess that you just know just about everything and everyone and the longer I watch you the more I learn. So I am very proud to be your son and happy birthday!

ad I remember so much with you because I'm still there.  There are many great memories. Spiritual, fun and wild adventures that you could always get us out of. Like when we picked up Edward from San Francisco airport. The motorhome broke down and you and I walked like 6 miles to find help. But you finally figured out a crazy way with the jumper cables. When I was little I got sick and you could always give me a blessing to make me better. I remember one time I was really sick and I couldn't walk, you gave me a blessing and by the end, I got up and ran around playing. It was so go to have you as a worthy priesthood holder and to be able to help us whenever we needed you. We had a lot of fun times too, like going to Great America and Dallas being sick and throwing up all over the theater there. I remember going to Florida and walking down the beach as a family, although you fell in the sand, it was fun. We went fishing there and you called us in, when we got in we looked out, there were tons of dolphins swimming right where we were. One of the greatest though was the Brer Rabbit stories. I still remember those and they were great. I always thought you made them up until I heard people say their mom told them those stories. Those were so fun! I remember I always wanted you to tell me stories. If mom was going to tell the story that night, Dallas and I would ask mom if you could tell us a story but mom would tell us thumpkin pie stories. Dad you have a shirt that doesn't lie, it says, World's Greatest Dad. Dad, to me you are the greatest and I love you.
