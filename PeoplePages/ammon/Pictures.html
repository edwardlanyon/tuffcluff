<b>AMMON</b><br>
<br>
<b>Fall 2004</b> Ammz is doing great in school. Still finding time to work on his music as 
well as all the homework and the paper route to earn a bit of cash. He loves 
to spend his extra time with Kevin doing whatever. Usually they go to the 
dunes and do four wheelin'. It is definitely the thing to do.
