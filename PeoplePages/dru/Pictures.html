<b>DRU</b><br>
<br>
<b>Winter 2005</b> No surface is safe for Dru, who is rolling over dangerously now. She is also learning to sit up and has even cut her first two teeth - and all at the tender age of only 6 months. Dru loves her big sister, Cage, who can make her laugh hysterically by jumping up and down.
