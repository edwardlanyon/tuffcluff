<b>SOPHIA</b><br>
<br>
<b>Summer 2005</b> Sophia gets bigger everyday, I really can't believe it and it's so sad to watch her grow up right in front of my eyes. She has beautiful blue/hazel eyes, dark hair (still), and is beginning to really show a bubbly, happy personality. However, she's still a little shy of strangers.
