<b>Put-Put Cars�</b><br>
A bizarre tradition with its origins in insanity. The 'car' crawls around on the floor like a spider (not face down on hands and knees but flipped over on hands and feet) saying "put-put-put-put" while the 'passenger' hangs on for dear life. A family home evening favorite. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Jack-the-Tripper�</b><br>
Dane invented this one. 'The Tripper' is supposed to lie supine in the center of the trampoline while the rest of the group runs the circular gauntlet around the perimeter. The Tripper must try to stay as close to the center as possible and may not roll over onto his/her stomach. The object is for the Tripper to catch and trip a victim (who them becomes the Tripper) by any means necessary. This usually entails grabbing a flailing limb and hanging on until the person takes a dive, surrenders or chips a tooth on the metal trampoline frame. More fun (and dangerous) than it sounds.

<br>
<b>Chicken Man�</b><br>
"CHICKEN MAN LEAVING IN 10 SECONDS! 9, 8, 7, 6, 5..." This was the call of the Chicken Man. The response was immediate. Those who heard the call would drop everything and book it to the living room. There they would find Dane squatting next to a couch, finishing the countdown. The first person to jump onto his shoulders before he got to zero, won. The prize was a shoulder ride--but not an ordinary shoulder ride--it was done blindfolded. The rider would cover Chicken Man's eyes with their hands and off they would go. Though Chicken man controlled the speed, he allowed the rider to control direction (thus limiting his liability for injuries incurred) by steering his head left or right. It was the rider's responsibility to prevent pain and death with precision steering around couches and coffee tables and quick evasion of oncoming walls or plants. Another Dane original. Not recommended for those with bad backs or Mom's sense of direction.

<b>Hide'n'Seek (Cluff Style)</b><br>
Every Saturday night was date night for Mom and Dad and a free-for-all for the kids. Mom would ensure that we were all freshly bathed and dressed in our Little House on the Prairie nightgowns. All the girls had a head-full of pink, spongy curlers and an innocent gleam in their eyes. Mom and Dad would leave safe in the knowledge that everything was ready for the Sabbath. But the second their taillights disappeared from view, on came the forbidden soaps (Dallas, Dynasty & Falcon Crest), out came the box pizza and pot pies and off came the housecoats and innocent expressions. When it got dark we'd head out to the pasture (which was unoccupied and overgrown after Daisy's untimely death) to play hide 'n' seek. Whoever was 'It' had to go into the barn and count to 50 while the rest of us dove for cover in the deep grass. Having to go into the dark barn alone was good incentive for finding a fantastic hiding spot in the grass. Hours later we'd straggle back into the house: itchy, irritated, grass-stained and muddy. We'd fight about who was responsible for locating the curlers and slippers we'd lost in the field until we fell asleep in a giant tangle of scraped knees and puffy eyes. Mom and Dad would return to find a mud trail on their carpet, an unsuitable program blaring on their television and a pile of Fagin's orphans in their livingroom. We'd always get the third degree--but come next Saturday night we'd be back out in the pasture lying low in the grass. Some things are just worth it.

<b>Lawn Maze</b><br> 
When Dane, who was responsible for 99% of our games (and injuries), was asked to mow the lawn he'd always make an event of it. He'd never mow boring old straight lines like the rest of the neighbors, he'd always make an elaborate and interesting maze for the rest of us to enjoy (until mom and dad would make him finish the job.  
<br>
<br>
<b>Name That Tune</b><br> 
Dane rarely let us go into his shanty room, but when he did it was usually either to watch him feed his pet black widow or for a game of Name That Tune - Dane style. He would select a bunch of singles from his record collection and play them to us with the rule that we would have to guess either the title of the song or the group (or sometimes both) before the title of the song was actually sung or leave his room. Of course the ace up his sleeve was that he had a particular song that started straight out with the title so we didn't have a chance! Still, it's a great game, and bears repeating.
