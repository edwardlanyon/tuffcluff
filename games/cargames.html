<b>ABC Game</b><br>
This is a race to complete the alphabet first using letters from signs, billboards, license plates and any other letters outside of the car. You must shout  
out each letter and where you found it before moving on to the next. Once a letter has been claimed by one person it's off limits to the other players. The  
winner is the first to Z.<br><br>

<b>Alphabet Game</b><br>
This is an add-on game. The object is to run through the alphabet using the first letters of things seen out of the window. An apple, an airplane or an  
ambulance gives you A, while a bull, a boat or a bakery gives you B. The letters must be spotted in the right order. You cannot count C for cow unless  
you've already seen something beginning with B.<br><br>

<b>Apples & Bananas</b><br>
Similar to the Alphabet Game, take turns thinking of words starting with A (apple) then B (banana) and continue adding on through the alphabet without  
forgetting what came before. This is good to play in the dark or on a particularly barren stretch of road since you don't need to find objects outside, you  
just think them up. To make it harder have a theme (food, British things, animals, musical instruments, etc)<br><br>

<b>Animal Rear End</b><br>
Start by saying an animal's game (kangaroo). The next person starts their animal with the last letter of my animal (kangaroO, Octopus). Everyone must  
listen really carefully because they can't repeat an animal or they're out.<br><br>

<b>Arms & Legs - An English Pub Game</b><br>
The people on the driver�s side of the car make up one team and the people on the passenger side, the other. Everyone needs to keep an eye out for the pubs  
on their side of the road, especially ones whose names contain anything with arms and legs. Points are awarded for every arm or leg each team claims.<br>
Examples:<br>
The King George would score 4 (2 arms and 2 legs)<br>
The Red Lion would score 4 (4 legs)<br>
The Coach and Horses would score 12 (Two horses and one driver equals 10 legs and 2 arms)<br>
The team with the highest score at the end of the journey wins. But for an automatic winner � keep a look out for The Beehive!<br><br>

<b>Badge Buster</b><br>
Each person takes a turn naming the make/badge of as many oncoming cars as they can (ie: Ford, MG, BMW, Ford, VW). The other passengers monitor how many they get right (one point per car) before they either can't name one or get one wrong. When this happens they're out and the next person takes their turn. The person with the most points wins. <br><br>

<b>Cloud Spotters</b><br>
Want a quiet, uncompetitive game for the kids? Have them look at the clouds and find weird, wonderful and whacky shapes.<br><br>

<b>Car Bingo</b><br>
Everyone in the car picks a color then counts the number of cars of their color that drive past. First person to spot 10 cars of their color and shout  
BINGO wins.<br><br>

<b>Cattle-Guard!</b><br>
Each time you go over a cattleguard you have to yell CATTLE-GUARD! or get pinched.<br><br>

<b>Dear Sir</b><br>
The driver picks two characters, fictional or otherwise, and the passengers take turns composing a letter from one to the other alternating one word at a  
time. Examples: Darth Vader to his Tailor, George Bush to Osama Bin Laden, the Twins to the Admissions Board at Harvard etc.<br><br>

<b>Desert Island Treasures</b><br>
You're going away to a desert island, alone, for one year. You'll have only the bare necessities (clothes, food, drink and shelter) to keep you alive. You  
are allowed to take five items with you. Tell us what they are and why.<br><br>

<b>Disconnect</b><br>
Two players quickly take turns thinking of random words that have nothing to do with each other. Harder than it sounds. The other people listen and try to  
find a connection between the words given. For instance: car, angel, cattail, fridge, book, etc� but if someone then says �sun� and the second person says  
�beam� the second person is out because you could make a connection between sun and beam.<br><br>  

<b>Ear, Ear</b><br>
The first player points to a part of their body and calls out the name of an entirely different part of the body. For example, touching his nose, he might  
say, 'This is my foot' or touching his ear, he might say, 'This is my mouth'. The next player goes through the same routine, indicating one thing but  
saying something completely different. The game carries on around and around, getting faster and faster. The quicker it goes, the more likely someone is to  
mess up. The game ends when someone forgets to say the wrong body part but says the actual one.<br><br>

<b>Face-Off</b><br>
The aim of this game is to mime an emotion using only your face. This is trickier than it sounds. The first player selects a feeling (angry, happy,  
baffled, hate, conceited, sea-sick, horror, disgust, jealousy, headache, cunning, misery etc.) and pulls a suitable face to portray it. The others try to  
guess what it is. The first to guess correctly gets the next turn.<br><br>

<b>Finish It!</b><br>
You'll need a newspaper, magazine or book. One player chooses a headline or short phrase to read out but omits an important word or two that would  
otherwise give away a major bit of the story. So if the headline was "Dangerous Dog Attacks Postman" the reader would only say, "Dangerous Dog Attacks..."  
without revealing that it was a postman. The players then try to fill in the blank and the winner is the first one to get it right. This can be hilarious  
depending on the sense of humor of the players.<br><br>

<b>Follow the Leader</b><br>
An action packed add-on game. The first player performs an action, such as nodding his head - twice. The next player copies this, and adds another action,  
say, slapping his legs four times. The third player repeats the first two actions then adds another. And so it goes, around and around. Eventually, it gets  
to the point where there are so many actions that a player forgets them or gets them wrong and has to drop out. The last player left wins.<br><br>

<b>Gas Gamblers</b><br>
As you pull in to a gas station to fill up each person guesses how much money it will cost to fill up the tank (in $5 increments). The winner gets a treat  
from the gas station store.<br><br>

<b>Green Gamblers</b><br>
Stuck at the traffic lights? When the light goes red, each of the passengers guesses how long it will be until it turns green. When they think it's about  
to change, they shout 'Change!'. The last to call before it goes green is the winner.<br><br>

<b>How's Business?</b><br>
One player declares what buisness s/he is in, "I'm in the dynamite business." Everyone else then asks, "How's business?" and are given the reply, "Booming!" Other examples include: snail farmer = slow, small shoes = a bit tight, yo-yos = up and down, carrot chopper = dicey, matress business = cushy, etc...<br><br>

<b>If I Were...</b><br>
Take turns answering the following: "If I were president, I would...." (can also use queen, celebrity, teacher, very rich, etc.)<br><br>

<b>I Spy</b><br>
Players take turns trying to guess which nearby object has been selected. Look around and silently select an object that can be seen by all the players.  
Say, "I spy with my little eye�" then give some description of the object, such as "something red," "something square" or "something small." The other  
players take turns trying to guess what the object is. The player who correctly guesses the selected item picks the next object. Offer extra clues if the  
players are completely stumped. This is difficult to do in the car because things are miles behind before anyone can start guessing them so instead you can  
play 'I Did Spy'. One player begins by noting an object outside and saying 'I did spy, with my little eye something beginning with...' or, if it was a cow,  
�something with four legs' or if it was a skyscraper, 'and it was very tall'.<br><br>

<b>It Was a Dark and Stormy Night...</b><br>
Start a story with this line and then continue telling it with a least one word per sentence from a road sign, billboard, shop or anything else you see as  
you drive along.<br><br>

<b>I Went Shopping and Bought...</b> <br>
One person starts and says "I went shopping and bought a...". The second person repeats the first person�s phrase and adds their own item and on, and on,  
and on, until someone or everyone forgets who bought what. The wilder and wackier the items the easier it is to remember and the more amazing the shopping  
list becomes. Where else could you have bought a speculum, a piece of Stinking Bishop cheese, a house made of goat hairs and a dimple for your chin? 
<br><br>

<b>Just a Minute </b><br>
You will need a stopwatch and a whistle. The contestant must speak on a given topic for 60 seconds without hesitation, repetition or deviation from the  
theme. Only the word or phrase of the topic may be repeated. Anyone can stop the game (and stopwatch) to challenge the contestant if they think s/he has  
broken any of the three no-nos. For each correct challenge the challenger is given one point, an incorrect challenge and the person being challenged  
receives the point. If the challenger is correct s/he also takes over the topic and remaining time. There is also a point for speaking when the whistle  
blows, and a bonus of one for the incredibly difficult task of speaking for the whole minute. When you get the hang of it this is one of the best games of  
all time!!<br><br>

<b>Journey in the Dark</b> <br>
All but one player must close their eyes tightly and put their heads down. The player who can see (hopefully the driver) describes what's passing by  
outside (cars, buildings, farms, people, etc.) giving a running commentary about what they are missing, however, the commentator has to slip in a few  
whoppers as well. S/he might describe a pond, a horse, or a windmill etc. that's not actually there. The others have to try and guess which facts are true  
and which are false. Each lie they catch the commentator in gives the catcher one point and each lie the commentator sneaks by gives s/he one point. The  
person with the most points wins. Take turns being the commentator for three minutes each.<br><br>

<b>License Plate Collector</b><br>
Competitive version: competitors try to find license plates from as many different states as possible. Once one is claimed, it�s off limits to the other  
players. Each person keeps track of the states they've found and the person with the most entries wins. Uncompetitive version: everyone works together to  
find as many as possible.<br><br>

<b>Looky Here</b><br>
The object is to stop yourself smiling by staring at one particular place while the others do their best to distract your attention. The distracters can do  
anything but touch the 'starer'. Meanwhile, someone is timing the 'starer' with a watch. The person who lasts longest before they crack a smile is the  
winner.<br><br>

<b>Measure a Mile</b><br>
How long does it take your car to travel one mile? The driver can keep an eye on the mile-o-meter while the passengers try to judge distances without help.  
When the driver tells them to, the players close their eyes. As soon as they think that a mile has gone by, they call out 'When!'. The driver, meanwhile,  
has been watching the mile-o-meter. The player whose call is most accurate is the winner.<br><br>

<b>Measure a Minute</b><br>
Tell the kids that you are going to time a minute on your watch. The kids have to estimate a minute in their heads and say when they think time is up. The  
closest one is the winner. This game can be extended to the two minutes (or any other length of time) when the children get good at it.<br><br>

<b>My Old Aunty Dorcas</b> <br>
The first player says, "My old Aunty Dorcas is a sight to see". The remaining players say together, "a sight to see, but why?" The first player describes  
what it is that makes Aunty so odd. He may say 'Her nose is always wrinkled up' and put an action to the words by wrinkling his own nose. Then all the  
other players must wrinkle up their noses in the same way. The second player now says, "My old Aunty Dorcas is a sight to see". When asked why, s/he gives  
the original reason and then adds a different answer. She may have her mouth hanging open, her cheeks puffed out, a finger up her nose, her eyes crossed or  
anything else he can think of. The game goes around so that each player has a chance to think up some new oddity. Each crazy action is added to the last  
until all the faces of the players are so contorted that someone fails to keep his under control. Any player who forgets the actions must drop out.<br><br>

<b>Name That Tune</b><br>
Start by tapping out the beat. If they can't get it, try humming the tune. If they still can't get it, sing the song. They have to get it before you sing  
the title of the song or they lose completely. The winner is the first person to guess correctly. Then it's their turn.<br><br>

<b>Nosey Neighbor</b><br>
In a traffic jam everyone chooses a window and takes a quick peek at the person in the car nearest to them. Then it�s up to you to decide what sort of  
person they are. Choose a name, give them a voice, pick a job, a favorite meal, decide where they've been today, etc. And for extra fun make the whole game  
a secret spy mission. Tell your kids that the aim is not to be seen looking by their chosen target. If they do their turn is over.<br><br>

<b>Odd Fingers</b><br>
A battle of wits with fingers. One player hides his/her right hand in a pocket, under a coat or under an armpit and keeps one, two, three or four fingers  
extended. Thumbs don't count. The other player then has to guess whether the number is odd or even. If s/he's right, s/he scores a point for each extended  
finger and takes the next turn. The first player to reach twenty-one points is the winner.<br><br>

<b>Odd One Out</b><br>
One person thinks of three people/things/numbers that are connected somehow and one that is random and unconnected to the other three. They then reveal the  
list of four things and everyone has to guess which is the odd one out. The person who guesses correctly takes the next turn.<br><br>

<b>Paper, Scissor, Rock</b><br>
The players both count aloud to three, each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count. On the third count the players change their  
hands into one of three following gestures:<br>
Rock: closed fist. <br>
Scissors: index and middle fingers extended. <br>
Paper: open hand. <br>
The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent. Gestures are resolved as follows:<br>
Rock smashes Scissors: Rock wins. <br>
Scissors cuts Paper: Scissors wins. <br>
Paper covers Rock: Paper wins. <br>
If both players choose the same gesture, the game is played again.<br><br>

<b>Point Search </b><br>
Object: to collect 100 points<br>
Cows or horses = 1 point each <br>
Sheep or Goats = 5 point each <br>
White Horse = 10 points<br>
Deer = 15 points <br>
Windmill = 20 points each <br>
Mule/donkey = 25 points each<br>
Ferraris = 30 points each<br>
Peg-legged man = automatic win!<br>
Cemetery = wipes out points - start back at zero <br><br>

<b>The Prime Minister's Cat</b><br>
The first person starts off by saying 'The Prime Minister's cat is'... and has to think of an adjective to describe the cat beginning with 'A' (angry,  
anxious, angelic etc). The next person carries on with the letter 'B' and so on.<br><br>

<b>Simon Says</b><br>
One player is chosen to be Simon. Simon tells the others to perform a series of actions: 'Put your hands on your head', 'Rub your tummy', 'Tap your toes'  
and so on. The players are only to obey the instructions when they are prefaced by the words 'Simon says...' If the order does not begin with these words  
the players should do nothing. Anyone who performs an action without the magic words has to drop out of the game. Likewise, anyone who doesn't perform an  
action when Simon says so must drop out. The last person remaining is the winner.<br><br>

<b>Sing-a-long</b><br>
Choose a song and all sing-a-long - easy-peasy!<br><br>

<b>Story Circle</b><br>
The driver picks a theme and the passengers take turns telling a story alternating one word or one sentence at a time. <br><br>

<b>Thumb War</b><br>
To play the game, opponents hook the four fingers of their hands together so that both hands are clasped tightly. Then say either: "one, two, three, four,  
I declare a thumb war five, six, seven, eight, try to keep your thumb straight. Nine, ten, let's begin" or "one, two, three, four, let's have a thumb war  
five, six, seven, eight pick your nose and don't be late". Then the opponents proceed to attempt to trap their opponent's thumb for three seconds, while  
avoiding the same.<br><br>

<b>TOAS - Think of a Story</b><br> 
Everyone chooses a passing car and memorizes the letters and numbers of its license plate. Now make a story using the letters as inspiration. Use the first  
letter to decide the name of the main character. The second letter can be an item or animal that�s in the story. And the third � what the character was  
doing.<br><br>

<b>Truth or Fiction?</b><br>
You'll need pocket dictionary for this game. The first player searches through the pages to find a word which s/he thinks nobody else will know the meaning  
of. Then s/he can decide whether to give the true definition of the word or make one up. If you want to make one up it's smart to read a different  
definition from another word on the same page so that it sounds official. Once the definition has been given, the others have to decide whether it is truth  
or fiction. If they guess correctly then the dictionary is handed on to the next person. If they guess wrongly, then the first player goes again.<br><br>

<b>Tunnel Time!</b><br>
Every time you enter a tunnel you have to hold your breath until the end. If the tunnel is super long, the last one left still holding their breath wins.
<br><br>

<b>Twenty Questions</b><br>
One player thinks of an object and the other players take turns to ask yes/no questions to determine what that object is � up to 20 questions. To make the  
game easier, s/he can classify the object as animal, vegetable or mineral. After hearing the answer, the questioner is allowed to guess the object. If the  
guess is correct, the winning questioner now thinks of a new object. If the answer is incorrect, another player is allowed to ask a yes or no question. If  
the players use up their 20 questions without guessing the object, the player with the object in mind reveals it and thinks of a new one.<br><br>

<b>Your Car, My Car</b><br>
In age order, take turns "owning" cars as they pass your car (or as you pass them). If you get a good car you can stick with it and if you get a bad car  
you can trade it up for another car next time it's your turn. Kids love this game even though there's no real ending or point. <br><br>

<b>Whatchamacallit</b><br>
The object of this game is to get the right answer by asking the wrong questions. One player thinks of an item. The others then ask questions to try and  
find out what it is. The person being questioned is not allowed to give a simple 'yes' or 'no'. Each reply must mention the secret item, but not by name -  
it should be called ' whatchamacallit' instead. Let's say the secret item is an apple. The questioners might ask 'Are you hungry?', to which the reply is,  
'No, I've got a whatchamacallit in my pocket'. The next question might be, 'Have you been to the doctor lately?', to which the reply is, 'No, I eat a  
whatchamacallit every day'. And so on.<br><br>

<b>What's My Line?</b><br>
The object is to guess a person's �line� of business or job by watching them mime an activity connected with it. After that, the guessers can ask up to  
twenty questions but the answers can only be 'yes' or 'no'. It's no good simply mouthing words and expecting people to work out that you're an actor! Try  
miming a dentist pulling out a tooth, or a gardener planting a tree, or a nurse taking a temperature?<br><br>

<b>What's The Story?</b><br>
Classic Version: One player has three minutes to tell a classic story, but can only tell it using sound effects. For example, The Three Bears could be:  
growling (bears), Mmmmm (time to eat), Ouch! (porridge is too hot), door slamming and stomp, stomp, stomping (going out for a walk) etc... The first player  
to guess the story wins.<br> 
Creative Version: Take turns making up stories using a series of noises (a creaky door, a screeching owl, a bubbling witch's cauldron, children screaming,  
etc). The other players try to guess what is happening in the sound story and the storyteller nods yes if they're on the right track or no if they're  
wrong.<br><br>

<b>Who am I?</b><br>
One person thinks of a famous person, real or fictional (Donald Duck, Superman, Shakespeare, The Queen etc). The other players have to try to work out who  
the person is by asking questions in turn. But the answers can only be 'Yes' or 'No'. The first person to guess the name correctly is the winner and gets  
to think of the next famous character. If nobody guesses the correct name, the first player reveals who he is, and has another turn. However, if the  
character he thought of is considered to be too obscure, then that player is disqualified.<br><br>

<b>Wrap Up</b><br>
You'll need an opaque bag and an assortment of small objects (keys, lipstick, coins, a handkerchief, a comb, etc). The leader should be sitting in the  
front seat so that the others can't see what is happening. One by one the objects are wrapped up in the plastic bag and handed over to the back. The  
players feel the bag and try to guess what is inside.<br><br>
