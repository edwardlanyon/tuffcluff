<a class=times15>Fluff�y [fluhf-ee] �noun 1. To expel intestinal gas; break wind.<br> See also: fluff, fluff�er, fluff�ed, fluffs, fluff'i�ness, fluff�i�er, fluff�i�ly and fluff�i�est </a> <br>
We are all more than familiar with this famous Cluff euphemism for umm... shall we say, "gastrointestinal disturbances" but, until now, no one knew where this Cluff-tastic word came from. Now Tuffcluff is proud to reveal that the origin of the fluff is a mystery no longer! Drum roll please. The clever person behind this famous "Cluff" word is� not even a Cluff at all (shock/horror)! The word, as we use it today, was invented more than 25 years ago by none other than Aunt Beverly! Pre-fluff, the poor Tuffcluff's had to make do with lame-o clich�d expressions such as "passed-air" or "passed-gas" - hardly the loveable, catchy little word we've all grown accustomed to. But then along came Aunt Bev's stroke of genius and everything changed! Now Cluffs the world over can enjoy this punchy, versatile word with the built-in bonus feature of a face-saving euphemism! It's a word that we've all come to depend upon, a real Cluff tradition. So if your child says anything else, it's time for a history lesson. Long live the fluff! <br>

<a class=times15>Hop�py Darn [hop-ee dahrn] -exclamation 1. Used to express surprise or confoundedness <br>(Org. "I'll be darned")</a><br>
Would you believe...it wasn't until she was an adult that Daisha discovered that when her father said "hoppy darn" what he was actually saying was "I'll be darned"? Another crazy Cluff misunderstanding!
