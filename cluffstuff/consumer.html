The Tuffcluff family is gargantuan. This can cause a lot of problems (like remembering birthdays) but it has its advantages too and we thought it was about time to capitalize on our advantages so we enlisted the  
expertise of Tuffcluffs the world over to create this cult guide to everything that is nice and good. It's essentially a shopping guide for the products that we think are fantastic - the best of the best. And if you know a Tuffcluff, you know that we like to get a good deal! This list is a work in progress, so if you have a tried and tested product to add please let us know.

Why: Quick, even heating and durable<br>
Who: Tiana <br>
Why: In my household appliances class in college we tested a whole range of pots and pans and the hard anodized beat everything. <br>

Why: We got ours cheap at Costco 3 yrs ago - they still look brand new<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/lecreuset.jpg" align=left>

Who: Daisha<br>
Why: The most durable, versatile, lovely piece of cookware I own. Plus it's super easy to clean.<br>

Why: you don�t have to peel the clove first!<br>

What: Smart Cook Knives<br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: They might be hard to find...I found them at the dollar store; black handle - blade goes all the way through the handle, start sharp; stay sharp; resharpen nicely; best price!<br>
<br>

What: Reynolds Oven Bags<br>
Who: Mel<br>
Why: This is our secret for a juicy Thanksgiving turkey.<br> 
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/bounty.jpg" align=left>
What: Bounty select-a-size Paper Towels<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: You can rip off a small piece, or keep a couple of pieces together to make a larger towel. Each small section does the job of at least 3 or 4 full- 
size cheap towels. They last longer because I�m usually only needing to use a small towel rather than a full-size one. I won�t buy a paper towel that  
doesn�t give me select-a-size options now. Not even regular Bounty.<br>
<br>

What: Electrasol power tabs <br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: These have jet dry; can use them even when they look nasty/old; they're pretty cheap at costco and they last forever! Nothing compares if you have a dishwasher<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/cascade.jpg" align=left>
What: Cascade with Dawn dishwashing packets<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: My dishes are always sparkling clean and there�s no messy powder or liquid to spill. Just make sure you don�t overload your dishwasher because nothing  
can clean dishes that are packed together, and it�s always a good idea to pre-rinse, especially if the food is dried on. Warning: If you buy them in the  
re-sealable plastic bag, make sure you double-check the seal after closing it because it�s a difficult one the zip shut and the packets will dry out and not  
work as well. I like buying the economy size because it has a plastic box with a flip top lid, so it�s always closed properly. <br>
<br>

What: Method dish soap<br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: Smells like cucumber (best "clean" smell there is); the only dish soap that doesn't make my hands freak out and it has this really cool twist/screw top that works better than any other<br>
<br>

What: Ziplock freezer bags<br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: These are great and re-usable.  You can label with a sharpie and then rinse out, scrub and refill/re-label.  Because they're "freezer" they're really tough and last a long time<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/tide.jpg" align=left>
What: Tide laundry detergent<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: I�ve always wanted yummy smelling laundry, and I hate dingy whites. Aunt Judy�s laundry always looks and smells great, and she uses Tide, so I tried  
it after years of cheap-o detergents and I can�t go back. There is a noticeable difference!!!<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/snug.jpg" align=left>
What: Orange scented fabric softener (I�m currently using Snuggle fabric softener- orange rush scent only!)<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: I�m obsessed with orange citrus scented cleaning products. I love them! I have to have fabric softener because few things in life drive me crazier  
than static and itchy fabrics, so I picked this brand because it was the only one with orange scent at the time. I love anything citrusy! It makes you feel  
cheerful while you do the drudgery of cleaning and washing. <br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/whitevin.jpg" align=left>
What: White vinegar/distilled vinegar (any brand)<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: My new fabric softener of choice (I learned about using it on TV from Sara Snow), and I�ve been trying to go more natural. It�s cheap too! The only thing is it has no static protection, so you�ve got to use dryer sheets in the dryer! I thought I�d miss my citrus softener, but I don�t. You can also use it in your dishwasher for rinse aid instead of jet dry.<br>
<br>

What: Bosch Dishwashers<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: I'm a lazy cleaner and need something that will do all the hard work for me, and that's what my Bosch Clasixx does! I'd never use anything else now that I've owned one. <br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/window.jpg" align=left>
What: A squeegee and the fluffy cleaning tool (looks like a furry squeegee) for cleaning windows<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: I saw that�s how they clean the store windows at Disneyland. Dad had one from his window cleaning days in Lake of the Pines, so I tried it. It�s fast  
and leaves the windows incredibly clean with absolutely no streaks. You wipe in one fluid motion, never lifting the squeegee from the glass until the final  
wipe across the bottom part of the glass. Windex, vinegar, newspaper, etc all seem to leave streaks and I�m never satisfied. You will never go back after  
trying this method.<br>
<br>

What: Rain-X<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: This really helps when you live in such a rainy place. The Anti-Fog spinoff is great for the interior and okay on my bathroom mirrors.<br>
<br>

What: Sherwin Williams paint<br>
Who: Scott<br>
Why: It�s the best<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/kilz.jpg" align=left>
What: Kilz paint<br>
Who: Mel (Tiana uses it too)<br>
Why: No, this is the best! <br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/cillit.jpg" align=left>
What: Cillit Bang (power cleaner)<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: I'm a lazy cleaner and like a product to do all the work for me so I don't have to sit around scrubbing. I'm not sure if it's available in the USA but this stuff is THE BEST (despite its lame-o name). I use it for almost everything. We have limescale from our hard water and I'd never use anything else to tackle it but the Bang.  <br>

Why: I used these before my wedding and my teeth were almost too white! Mel has used them too with great results<br>
<br>

What: Sonic Care toothbrush<br>
Who: Steve<br>
Why: It does all the work and lasts forever - never going back to manual!<br>
<br>

What: Dove cool moisture soap<br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: Smells the best, works the best, has same power that puffs plus has - magic lotion?<br>

Who: Daisha<br>
Why: Edward and Dakota have been using this for a few months but I'm the one who loves it! It smells so good and works for AGES!<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/colgate.jpg" align=left>
What: Colgate Fresh Confidence toothpaste<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: It�s a gel (I hate pastes), it has just the right amount of foaming, it has a great flavor, it keeps your breath fresh for a long time (which is great for the Cluff halitosis), it�s relatively cheap, the one drawback is that WalMart out here stopped carrying it, but I found it at Kmart so I stocked  
up.<br>
<br>

What: Colgate Total plus whitening toothpaste<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: The best<br>
<br>

What: Always<br>
Who: Cage<br>
Why: There are no other competitors in this department<br>
<br>
<img src="../features/Pictures/always.jpg" align=left>
What: Always<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: I�m with Cage. I�m loyal to Always brand pads, but more specifically Always Ultra Thin pads with wings are the only pads to use. They�re so thin you forget you�re wearing anything. Forget risking TSS and just use these and you won�t be sorry.<br>
<br>


What: Herbal Essences shampoo & conditioner <br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: Esp. the conditioner. A great everyday conditioner. Smells good and untangles my superfine, supertangly hair. My hairdresser was the one who originally recommended it to me (she had to tell me on the sly because she was supposed to be pushing the salon stuff). <br>
<br>
<img src="../features/Pictures/mk.jpg" align=left>
What: Mary Kay Microdermabrasion<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: Nothing has made my skin feel or look so great. I�ve been hooked on it since the first time I sampled it. It�s the product that got me into MK.<br>
<br>

What: Mary Kay Liquid Foundation<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: I don�t have to go crazy trying to find the right shade in the make-up aisle at a store only to get it home and find it doesn�t match or I don�t like  
it. It has the perfect coverage, color and texture.<br>
<br>

What: Great Lash mascara (pink & green tube)<br>
Who: Nearly every Tuffcluff girl and all their friends<br>
Why: It's not clumpy, flaky or nasty and the price is right <br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/p&p.jpg" align=left>
What: Boots No 7 Protect and Perfect serum/Rewind and Refine serum (stronger version of P&P)<br>
Who: Melanie and Daisha<br>
Why: The only anti-aging product we've found that makes a bit of difference (It's a cult phenomenon in the UK). You can only get it at Target in the US  <br>
<br>

What: Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Skincare Purifying 3 in 1 Cleanser/Toner/ Exfoliant<br>
Who: Melanie<br>
Why: Great for keeping breakouts at bay for both Soren and me. Smells good, feels clean and exfoliates.<br>
<br>

What: Revlon Nail Polish<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: A favorite of mine and my friend June's since high school. It goes on smooth and thick for perfect coverage in one coat and seems to last ages. <br>
<br>


What: Waxed, minted floss<br>
Who: Scott<br>
Why: Clean and refreshing<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/mach3.jpg" align=left>
What: Gillette Mach 3 razor<br>
Who: Tiana (this is one of Hyrum's favorites too)<br>
Why: I�ve tried all kinds, even the girl kinds, but when I tried Hyrum�s Mach 3, I had to buy one for myself. I�ve been recommended to other kinds, but  
none compare for me. It�s amazing!<br>
<br>

What: Farouk Silk Therapy + Enjoy shine spray <br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: This is the miracle that cures all shampoo/conditioner shortcomings.  Use dime size of therapy after wash/condition; then blowdry with brush and spray LESS THAN than 4 times with shine spray and you will look like a movie star GUARANTEED!!!  Caution - too much shine spray will result in greasy look<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/burts.jpg" align=left>
What: Burt�s Bees Baby Bee Buttermilk Lotion. <br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: It�s the most heavenly scent you can imagine. I started using it on Talea and can never use any other product because it leaves my babies smelling delicious! All Burt�s Bees products are natural, and addicting to me.
<br>
<br>

What: Polo Cologne for men<br>
Who: Tasha<br>
Why: Best smelling cologne a man can buy; there must be some pheremone technology in there; however, remember that LESS IS MORE (over-use/abuse is worse than the cheapest nasty stuff)<br>
<br>

<img src="../features/Pictures/puffs.jpg" align=left>
What: Puffs Plus (sometimes labeled Plus Lotion) facial tissues<br>
Who: Tiana<br>
Why: You will never get a red, chapped nose even if you�re blowing all day for a month if you use these and only these tissues. I learned about this brand  
while dating Jamie, who had horrible allergies, and he�d only use these or his nose would be hamburger. Don�t blot oil from your face with these because  
they�ll leave you looking fuzzy!<br>
Converts: Daisha - I bring them back from the US and don't let anyone use them unless they have a serious cold!<br>
<br>

What: Tweezerman tweezers<br>
Who: Daisha<br>
Why: They may seem a bit expensive for tweezers but once you've tried them the price is more than justified!<br>

<li><b>Cascade with Dawn dishwashing packets (Tiana) vs. Electrasol power tabs (Tasha)</b><br>

<br>

<li><b>Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Ice Cream (Edward) vs.Haagen-Dazs ice cream (Shira)</b><br>
<b>Evidence:</b>It's impossible to have a winner since it's all down to personal taste, but according to kerroncross.blogspot.com, "The packaging for the Ben & Jerry's pint containers is made from recycled, bleach-free paper. The company is supporting research into thermoacoustic refrigeration to minimize the potential negative environmental impact from using ozone-depleting refrigerants. As a whole the company is very eco-friendly and encourages its users and consumers to be the same. And in 2005, Ben and Jerry's opened a store in Austin, Texas, operated by LifeWorks, a community organization that helps at-risk youth and families. The store provides job opportunities for LifeWorks clients. All profits from the store go directly to LifeWorks and Ben and Jerry's does not collect a franchise fee. Whereas H�agen-Dazs is a Nestle brand in the US and Canada - and we all know about Nestle's ethical record." On the other hand, consumersearch.com says, "Best vanilla ice cream. H�agen-Dazs Vanilla is top-picked by taste testers more often than any other flavor or variety of ice cream -- vanilla, chocolate or low-fat. However, some people aren't fond of the dense texture and sweetness of H�agen-Dazs ice cream, preferring vanilla varieties from Dreyer�s instead. (Ben & Jerry's Vanilla is also a top pick, but suffers from the same sweetness/denseness issues.) Note that we were surprised to find that H�agen-Dazs Chocolate doesn't do nearly as well in tests as the Vanilla variety." <b>Verdict:</b>Listen to your conscience<br><br>

<li><b>Garnier Fructis shampoo & conditioner (Shira & Cage) vs. Herbal Essences shampoo & conditioner (Daisha)</b><br>
<b>Evidence:</b> Consumersearch.com says, "Reviewers pick Clairol Herbal Essences most as the best shampoo. In blind testing, low-priced drugstore shampoo like Herbal Essences is shown to clean just as well as expensive salon brands. Herbal Essences comes in a variety of formulas, but some experts note that although these formulas are labeled differently, they have nearly identical ingredients, except for some variance in plant extracts, which don't have any effect on hair." <b>Verdict:</b> Herbal Essences<br><br>

<li><b>Colgate Fresh Confidence toothpaste (Tiana) vs. Colgate Total plus whitening toothpaste (Daisha)</b><br>
<b>Evidence:</b> There's not much between the two because they're both Colgate, but critics tend to lean toward Daisha's choice. Consumersearch.com says, "Best toothpaste overall: Experts recommend Colgate Total more often than any other toothpaste. According to both the Food and Drug Administration and the American Dental Association, this was the first toothpaste on the market to include the antibacterial ingredient Triclosan, which has been proven effective for fighting gum disease (gingivitis). Total contains another ingredient -- Gantrez -- that allows Triclosan to remain active between brushings, even after you eat or drink." <b>Verdict:</b> Colgate Total (the whitening is just a bonus!) <b>Rebuttal:</b>  "I have to disagree with your verdict about Total vs Fresh Confidence toothpaste. I�ve tried both. When I couldn�t find Fresh Confidence at Walmart, I bought Total with whitening, but couldn�t stand it after having used the other. Total�s foaming factor isn�t near so nice, the freshing doesn�t last as long, and its texture isn�t even as good. Total may have fancy ingredients, but mine may too (I�ll have to check), and mine is sooo much better in a blind usage test. Try it and I promise you�ll see what I mean. Plus, Fresh Confidence is whitening too. Clinical testing documents that your breath will stay fresh for a minimum of 3 hours. If you have a problem with bad breath, I�d definitely steer you toward Fresh Confidence with whitening. If you have a gingivitis problem, Total may be better for you."<br>

<li><b>Sherwin Williams paint (Scott) vs. Kilz paint (Mel & Tiana)</b><br>
<b>Evidence:</b> "I was looking at paint ratings on www.consumerreports.org and found that Kilz, among a few others, is a CR best buy, and it�s ranked 2nd for satin sheen (my favorite), but Sherwin-Williams is dead last in every sheen (of roughly 20 different paints in each sheen), and it�s the 2nd most expensive, so I guess us girls know what�s best after all. Behr paint is said to be the best, but I�ve never tried it personally. They use Behr all the time on the home improvement shows. For semi-gloss, CR says you�ll want either Behr or Dutch Boy. I�ve tried Dutch Boy before and I like that its container is square and plastic like Kilz, and I was satisfied. I�ve never tried the semi-gloss of it though. Since I�m a WalMart shopper, I�ll be getting Kilz satin, as always, and I guess I�ll use the Dutch Boy semi-gloss on my trims. It�s cheaper too!" <b>Verdict:</b> Kilz <b>Rebuttal:</b> From consumersearch.com: "Best EXTERIOR house paint. When asked to identify the best exterior house paint, building and painting contractors name Sherwin-Williams Duration more than any other paint. It's also mentioned as a better alternative when pros are asked about other paints. The major drawback is a high price, but every periodical and Internet how-to article says expensive paints are a good value because they last much longer than economy paints. Duration house paint is guaranteed for as long as you own your house. Experts say Duration applies and bonds better than other exterior paints and hides pre-existing paint or primer." </b> <br>

<b>Shopping for Baby Stuff By Tiana</b><br> For me, safety is the biggest issue. If I have a rollover accident, or if I get hit head-on, will my kid�s car seat keep my kid safe? At first when I bought stuff for Talea (jogger, etc), I just bought a good deal. But after the frustration and headaches of cheap crap, I decided to research them. My top four factors (in order of importance) before I make a purchase are safety, ease of use, aesthetics and price. For references, I use: <br>
<li>Consumer Reports.org<br>
<li>Girlfriends Guide to Baby Gear (a book)<br>
<li>Consumer Reviews on different websites<br>
<li>The internet is my best friend when it comes to research<br>
I narrow the results down that I compile from these sources, then I try to find them in a store so I can look at it and see what it�s really like in real life, and try it out. <br><br>
<img src="../features/Pictures/jogstroller.jpg" align=left>
My top recommendation for <b>stroller/jogger combo:</b><br>
If you�re going to have more than one child, and they�ll both need to ride:<br>
Phil and Ted�s sport double buggy: (4.75 out of 5 stars) I got the E3 when it came out, but it�s discontinued because they�ve added a safety guard to the wheels in the new sport double that I wish mine had. It comes in a wide variety of colors, and it converts from a single to a double, but it�s never wider or longer than a single. For Talea, I had a car seat/stroller combo, and a jogger, and an umbrella stroller. When Hyatt came along, I bought the E3 and this took the place of all of these, plus they both could ride, so I sold the others. It lays flat for a newborn while the older child rides up top in front. Then when the baby can sit, it sits in the back while the older child rides in front. It�s the best $$ I ever spent on my kids, but it was spendy.<br> 

<b>Pros:</b> Too many to mention them all, but here�s some: Converts from single to double, lots of colors to choose from, accommodates new infant, lots of accessories (the saddle bags, rain shield and sun shade are worth the extra investment), folds easily and compactly for a double stroller, front wheel can be free or locked,<br>  

<b>Cons:</b> Expensive, doesn�t come with a hand brake for downhill walking/jogging, the back kid can kick the front kid in the hind end to the point of annoyance, no cup holder (but just buy a BOB one that straps to the handlebars and you�re good to go. It has 2 cup holders and a pocket for stuff, plus it provides shade for the kid in back.), hard to find one to try before you buy<br>

<b>Where to buy:</b> check it out at www.philandteds.com, but it�s in New Zealand, so just price shop on Google or something and get it in the states. By the way, the price only varies by cents no matter where you look, unless you get it used on ebay, so I found a site that gave a couple of accessories with it for cheaper. I can�t remember what it was, so just hunt around.<br>
