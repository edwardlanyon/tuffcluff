<b>Some things we like to do in EYNSFORD:</b><br>
<br>
Our little village is a busy place with plays, festivals, parades and fairs going on year round. There’s also a farmer’s market every Friday with local produce, flowers, bread, jam and crafts. We often go down to the river to play in the water, feed the wild swans or have a picnic. We also love going for picnics at our castle, an 11th century ruin. Other local historical points of interest include the Lullingstone Roman Villa (75AD), Lullingstone Castle (with its award winning World Garden) and Eagle Heights - a bird of prey center that teaches the ancient art of falconry. Down the road are acres of lavender fields that perfume the whole valley when they're in bloom. There are loads of country parks, walking trails and picturesque villages to visit nearby. Some of England's most beautiful castles are just a quick car journey away (Leeds, Bodium, Hever, Rocester, Dover etc.). There are lots of stately mansions, midieval manors, adorable cottages and amazing gardens open for visitor in the vicinity as well. We live fairly close to the 100 acre wood (from Winne the Pooh), the world famous Canterbury Cathedral and the family homes of Darwin, Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens and Winston Churchill.
