<b>Introduction:</b><br>
I was born at Mesa, Ariz. Dec. 7, 1892. My parents were good Latter Day Saints. They provided a good home for their family. We were farmers and besides housework we children had our chores about the farm also.<br><br>
When I was 13 years old we moved to Bluewater, New Mex. My father homesteaded and built up a cattle ranch. With my grandfather's families adding to the few families there, a ward was established and a log church house was built. The county furnished a teacher and school was held there also.<br><br>
All who received more than a seventh grade education went to the church academy at St. Johns, Arizona. I was fortunate to get parts of three years there, and also took piano lessons. The third year at Xmas time I returned home. My parents had gone into the general mercantile business and I went to work helping in the store. Mayner came to Bluewater that spring and we were married in the fall.<br><br><img src='Pictures/bluewtr2.jpg' align=right>
Most of my activities in the church have been in primary work. I taught in Sunday school for about 20 years. I have also been Sunday School and ward organist.<br>

When Collins was three years old, and we were living in Gallup. He had ask me what made the sun, moon & stars shine, I'd told him Heavenly Father. So one night as he was standing in the door, he said, "Heavenly Father turn on the lights." It was at that instant the city street lights went on. He turned back into the house well satisfied Heavenly Father had heard his request.<br><br>
How I appreciated the good manners my children always displayed when company came into our home. They did everything they knew how to to be helpful to me and our guests.<br><br>
I remember how when Mayner & I would be gone all day, usually upon arriving home we'd find the house spick & span. A real overhauling.<br><br>
I have never had a son-in-law or daughter-in-law say an unkind word to me. I wish I could say the same.<br><br>
I remember in the year 1919 we were living in the Zuni Mountains, working for John Ervin. We had three small children at that time. I cooked for the ranch hands and Mayner did farm work for which we received $75.00 a month with house and food furnished. There was a store, the house we lived in at the side of the store, Mr. Ervin's home & a big new store house, besides the outer buildings all in a group. This night I am thinking of, a dance was being held in the new storehouse. Mayner had worked at the store until about 10 o'clock and had just come home and got to bed, when we heard a great commotion outside and a light glared into our bedroom. Mayner jumped out of bed and into his clothes in seconds time. Our house was, about 25 or 30 feet from the fuel store between which stood a half dozen barrels of gas. Someone had been getting gas, and from spilt gas started a fire. I looked out over the scene. People from the dance just standing watching the fire spread among the barrels. Women screaming. Mayner went in among the barrels and began moving one out. Some men come to take them as he rolled them out one at a time. I could see the last three barrels beginning to bulge at the top. I wanted to scream for him to get away from them but I couldn't. Seemed like hours as awful thoughts went through my mind. If those barrels of gas exploded the whole place & people would be one raging fire, but the last barrel was moved at last. Next morning I knew I didn't just see things. Three of the barrels were bulged terribly at the top. What seemed strange to me was that not one other man would go into that heat and roll out those barrels.<br>
