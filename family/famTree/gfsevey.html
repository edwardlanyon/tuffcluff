George Francis Sevey, was born 26 August 1878, in Panguitch, Utah. <br><br>

            �I attended school each winter and progressed quite rapidly, so that by the time I was nine I passed the fifth grade. I was ten when we arrived on the ranch in Mexico and helped father most of the time and got very little schooling.  Schooling was not compulsory there and father needed my help.  We lived about three miles from town and I walked to and from school part of the time and rode a horse some of the time, when I was able to go to school.  I got only a half year in the eighth grade in the Juarez Stake Academy and that ended my formal schooling.<br><br><img src='Pictures/gfsevey2.jpg' align=right> 

�The summer when I was 11 years old I had a real exciting experience.  Father and Mother were at the corral milking, and it was about a half an hour after dark.  I was sitting in a chair near the center of the room, facing the open door, holding the baby on my lap and a friend who was visiting me was sitting nearby on the floor.  Suddenly our dog came bounding into the house and ran under the bed, yelping, frightened nearly to death, his hair all bristled.  A large mountain lion came and put both front feet inside the door.  The lights seemed to frighten him, for he remained in that position.  My friend jumped up on the bed, very frightened, and I laid the baby on the bed and got father�s old 45-70 rifle, but when I turned back the lion had gone.  I held the gun on my lap until the folks came in from the corral.  We told them what had happened, but they just laughed.  However, next morning the lion�s tracks were very plain in the yard and the men tracked him into the canyon for three or four miles. My father gave me a 44 caliber Winchester rifle when I was 11 years old.  I did considerable hunting in those early days.  The deer, turkey, cougars, lions, bears, ducks, and many kinds of wild life were plentiful. I soon traded my rifle for a good 45 colt six shooter and a fine dagger, which I wore all the time when I rode about either hunting or after cattle, and I kept the family pretty well supplied with wild game.  In my younger days I learned to swim very well and many times when the river was very high, bringing down large trees and drift wood, and boiling, I would swim out for a mile down the stream.  <br><br>

�In January 1899 I went with father to Colonia Chuichuppa.  This was a little town in the tops of the Sierra Madre Mountains.  Father had taken a contract for building a trail from Chuichupa to the Seven Star min in Guaynopa Canyon, a distance of 22 miles through a very rough, rugged, wild country.  We established a little store in the home of J.W. Heder, and father left me there in charge of his affairs.  It was there I met and wooed Anna, the daughter of brother Heder.  It was on the second of September 1900, that I started, in company with Anna C. Heder, my intended wife, and my sister Mahala, for Utah, to get married and to visit our relatives.  We attended Conference in Salt Lake City, and on 9 October 1900, we went through the temple and were sealed.  We lived in Mexico for 12 years then, due to trouble with Mexican bandits, we moved to Arizona.� <br><br>

He died 21 January 1954 of a hear attack, in Mesa, Arizona.
