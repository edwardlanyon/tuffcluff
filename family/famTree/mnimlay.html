<center><b>MARGARET NEBRASKA IMLAY (1853-1897) </center></b><br>
<img src='Pictures/mni.jpg' align=left> 
Margaret Nebraska Imlay, was born, 5 June 1853 on the plains of Nebraska, while her parents were crossing the plains. �Maggie� married George Washington Sevey Jr. on 29 August 1868, shortly after her fifteenth birthday, in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City.  George was 36 years old at the time.  Her first three children all died in infancy and by the time her fourth child George Francis was born, she poured all her mother love into her care for him, and as a result he was thoroughly spoiled.  How he ever grew out of it is truly a mystery, as there were ten years of this spoiling before Maggie had another child.  She had three more children, Minerva, Phoebe and Leon.<br><br><img src="Pictures/gfsevey.jpg" align=right>

            Maggie was quite a favorite with everyone.  She was full of life and fun and grace, and was a regular �cut-up�, always ready to do her part in anything, and being the life of any party.  She enjoyed telling a �gusty� story and did not worry whether the listener was male or female.  If she thought it was interesting, she told it.  At times her language became �rich�, especially when she was angry or upset, or just plain full of nonsense.  She saw no reason to �hold her tongue� just because others did not use the same expressions.<br><br>

            She was a hard worker, for besides her dairying, she kept an extremely neat and clean house, did all her own washing, ironing, mending, knitting, and sewing.  She made socks for the whole family.  People marveled at this small woman and how fast and hard she worked.  Every afternoon she would pick up her knitting or mending and go visit a friend or dear one while she worked.  This was, for her, recreation, and she become noted for these visits and loved deeply for them.  Years after her death, her children were respected as the �son or daughter of Maggie Sevey�!<br><br>
<img src="Pictures/gwsmni.jpg" align=left>            All her adult life Maggie kept a dairy, milking the cows herself, since she was better at it than most men.  She would make and sell butter and cheese.  She had quite a number of cows of her own that her father and brothers had given her.  In 1887 Maggie moved to Colonia Juarez Mexico. When they first arrived in Mexico, Maggie had very little with which to feed her little family.  She used cornmeal in many ways, making cornmeal mush, corn bread, and any other way she could think of, using molasses for sweetening, George traded for three cows.  Again Maggie went into the dairying business and with the vegetables from her little garden, and the milk, butter and cheese from her dairy, she again was able to set a fine meal before her family.  <br><br>


            In a few years she had about 40 cows to milk and care for.  They were all of good stock, and she was careful to breed them well.  She gave her family a warm breakfast by candlelight, milked her cows twice daily, made cheese every day, churned butter three times a week, did all her own housework, cooked three hot meals a day, and many times she had tow to six or eight extra people to feed.  Maggie kept up a farm with �dairy cows the finest anywhere, and horses the same quality.�  <br><br>

            Little Maggie was honest to a fault, and fearless in defending the right, who did not hesitate to tell people what she thought and how she felt whether it be to their liking or not.  Maggie was a small, brown haired, blue eyed woman who had myriads of friends both male and female.<br><br>

In her early forties and before her  youngest baby turned two, Maggie died of cancer while her husband was transporting her from Mexico to Utah, 19 October 1897.  She was buried in the family burial plot in Panguitch. <br>
