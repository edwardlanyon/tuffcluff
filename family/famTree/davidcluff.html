<center><b>DAVID CLUFF <br> By Dennis Cluff</center></b><br>

John Clough came to America in 1635 on the ship Elizabeth with his wife Jane. Apparently he was either divorcing himself from his family or they had disowned him, because after a lot of money and research we have not been able to determine for certain who his parents were in England. His descendents were John II, Benoni, Ichabod, Zacheus, William, David, Moses, Robert, Raymond, Dennis, Dane, and Ammon.  Ammon being the 13th generation Cluff in America.<br><br>
David joined the church in 1830 after receiving a Book of Mormon from Martin Harris. David's father had taken his family to eastern Canada when David was young and had to return to the USA because of Indian problems. Thus David�s interest in Indian inhabitants and a thirst for the things in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>
He was a shipbuilder in Durham, New Hampshire and moved his young family to Kirtland (his wife�s first child a daughter and a son). He labored on the Temple with his trade as a carpenter. They moved again, headed for Missouri, but most of the family turned ill on the way so they stopped in Springfield, Illinois and by the time they could move on the Saints had gone on to Commerce.  So, they went on to 'Nauvoo".  His home is just a block or two North (I think North) of the Temple.<br><br>
They had a daughter and eventually 12 sons.  David Jr. then Moses, my great grandfather. David worked on the Nauvoo Temple too.  He was called on a mission and had to sell all his carpenter tools to finance the mission.  When he returned he had no to tools to work with. A couple days later a man came to the house and asked if they had room for a boarder for a short time, he would try to pay his way.  Sure.  What did he do? He told them he was a 'tool maker'.  In the next short while he replaced all of David�s tools.  When that was done he bid one of the boys goodbye and left.  The boy ran to the father and told him the man was leaving.  They hurried to the door and outside... but could not fine the man anywhere.  He seemed to have vanished. William (Bill) Wallace was another son... the boy mentioned in the "cow" episode.  Pres. Faust told that story in General Conference a couple years ago.<br><br>
The family left with the saints headed west.  Because of their New England background, the prophet asked them to stop in Mt. Pisgah, Iowa and harvest maple syrup and help the saints coming later.  Two years later they moved on to Winter Quarters and raised a huge garden.  Just in time to catch the 49er gold seekers trek to California.  They sold bushels of produce to them at great prices and financed their "Conestoga" wagon for the trip to Utah.<br><br>
Being a ship builder by trade, you can imagine that their 'covered wagon' was a 'Cadillac'.  They enjoyed the trip to Utah.  David Jr. and Moses has gone on ahead as teamsters for another man.  When the family got to Salt Lake City, the boys met them and persuaded them to go on to Provo, where they were one of the earliest settlers of that community when they all still lived within the "fort".  The Cluff family was the first to leave the fort and settle on the "bench" part of town.  With a large family, they built irrigation ditches and were successful farmers.<br><br>
William W. went to Hawaii with Joseph F. Smith (who was only 15) and were early missionaries in there. Moses moved on to Indian country in Arizona to the Gila (Heela) valley, where my grandfather and father were raised.  They were acquainted with Pres. Kimball who was living in the valley too.  In fact when Pres. Kimball�s mother passed away, His father later remarried to a Josephine Cluff.  Whenever Pres. Kimball saw my grandfather, he greeted him as on old friend.<br><br>
When Moses was living in Arizona and his father David was still in Provo, David in his old age now had decided that he wanted to move once more, to Arizona. The family was unable to dissuade him so on the occasion of Pres. Young�s visit to Provo the family persuaded him to come talk to David.  He was still adamant so Brigham Young suggested that he wait one year. If he still wanted to go, then he should probably go.<br><br>
On the one year anniversary of that promise he got up in morning and began making preparations to GO! Moses came up and got them.  On their way back to Arizona, they fell in love with the showlow area of the Northern part of the state with its beautiful pine trees and green meadows.  They decided that they would rather stay here than go back to the desert. So for the seventh time in David�s life he got out of his wagon, took his axe and with the help of his sons they commenced to cut down trees to build themselves another home. One year later an Indian agent came to them and told them they had settled on Indian Reservation land and could not stay there. So they moved on to their next home in the Gila valley.<br><br>
Moses had three wives and my grandfather was the 26th of 27 children. My father was also born there in the Gila valley in the town of Pima, in 1914.  I came along in 1939, Dane in 1966 and Ammon in 1989.  David's descendants from those 12 sons (several of whom were polygamous) evolved into the largest 'family' in the church, which the General Authority told Diana and I when Pres. Baird, Pres. Nielson and I were released in 2000. <br><br>
Thanks for listening, I am proud of my heritage, and it was a mystery to me until just before I left for my mission to Norway in 1959. I have tried to not have that as a mystery to my children.

<center><b>DAVID CLUFF <br> By Diana Cluff</center></b><br>
David is a lot like Jacob in the Bible, whose name was changed to Israel. David changed his name from Clough to Cluff. Israel had 12 sons and one daughter and that was what David had too. Israel had four wives and David had two. One of David's wives only had one child, a son; she may have died in childbirth as the other wife raised the son. His wife, Elizabeth, had a child every two years until she was 47 years old; 12 children: 11 sons and one daughter. <br><br>
David served in the 1812 War at 22 years of age. He married at 29 years. In Durham New Hampshire he was a ship builder. He joined the church at 35 after riding on a river boat with Martian Harris and being told about the Book of Mormon. He was interested in the Indians and after reading their history in the Book of Mormon he received a witness of the spirit that the church was true. <br><br>
After he joined the church he used his skills to help build the Kirtland temple. At age 42, and now with seven children, he was called on a mission to Canada. When he came back at age 43 he took his family to Missouri but on the way the whole family (except he and his eldest son) were sick with fever so they stopped their journey and were spared having to pass through the bad times that the others had to suffer; being beat up, shot at, raped, their homes burned and even killed. (See the movie Brigham Young for more detail). Later, when he lived in Nauvoo he went on a second mission to the Eastern States.<br><br>
His Elizabeth knitted and sewed her children's clothes and socks very fast. She raised all 12 of her children to adulthood. She gloried in her boys, praised them, prayed for them and loved them extra amounts. She only used a midwife, not a doctor when giving birth. She only used a doctor once in her life, when a son dislocated his elbow. She was one woman that even men wouldn't stand up to, she was tough! Once the Nauvoo legion tried to take her barrel of flour as they were trying to get supplies for their men under attack. It was her last barrel and she had many children to feed, and told the men so. They insisted she give what she had in the house for the army. She marched up to them saying, "You will take this flour over my dead body". The army left without the flour.<br> <br>

One baby was born at Mount Pisgah, where the Prophet asked the Cluffs, the only Cluffs in the church, to tend maple trees and get syrup. This was something the Cluffs were extra good at. The family then went to Mosquito Creek to plant crops for two years to raise the money to build a covered wagon, to buy tools for farming and to get a year�s supply of food and clothing. The gold rush came when one of our men in the Mormon Battalion discovered gold in Sacramento.  Many wagons came through Mosquito Creek traveling to the gold rush. David was their grocery store with his garden food for sale. With the money he made he was able to make a fantastic wagon for his family to cross the plains.<br> <br> 
David takes after Israel in not only having many children and lots of action in his life but also in being faithful. The David Cluff family is the biggest family in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints today.
