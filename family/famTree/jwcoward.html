<center><b>JOHN WILLIAM COWARD</center></b><br>
John William Coward lived in Colonial Chuichupa, Mexico. This was a little town of about thirty families located in a beautiful valley in the tops of the Sierra Madre Mountains. The valley is about two miles wide and three and a half miles long, completely surrounded by stately pines and low rolling hills running back to high mountain peaks and ridges. The valley is about 7000 feet above sea level, with black alluvial soul. In the summer it is a veritable flower garden, with seemingly thousands of different colors and kinds of flowers.
