<center><b>RAY HASSELL (1923- 2002)</center></b><br>


<b>Introduction By Diana George Cluff</b><br><br>
I thought you might enjoy this history of Uncle Ray. He was a good man, full of service and always trying to do the best he could in life. I learned how to walk by holding onto his tie down the streets of Grants, New Mexico. I was also sealed to my parents at the same time he and Grace went to the Mesa Temple to be sealed.  At that time people had to save war bonds for gas to make trips to be married or sealed in the temple. Ray and Grace and my parents went together to be sealed. Dennis and I also were married in the Mesa Temple to carry on that tradition. I lived next door to him on Clay Street in Ashland as a child until I was married. After about 12 years of marriage he invited Dennis and I to live next door to him again and we still live there today. <br><br>
Aunt Grace Hassell's maiden name was Whetten. When our Grandfather Mayner Hassell's father was killed by a falling tree on his tent, his wife's next marriage was to a Whetten who had been Great Grandfather Hassell's good friend. Great Grandfather Hassell's first wife had died leaving him with four children before his second marriage. <br><br>
When you read this history you will understand why people thought Uncle Ray and Aunt Grace were related or cousins though it wasn't through blood lines just second marriages. <br><br>

<b>Dad�s Funeral 9 August 2002 <br> By Arlene</b><br><br>
							

Thank you for coming today  to honor my father.  It means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot to my mother and the rest of the family. <br><br>

I want to tell you a little bit about my Dad. He was born on a Wednesday, February 7th, 1923 to Mayner May Hassell and Annie Lamb in Mesa, Arizona.  He joined two brothers, Lee and Collins, and a sister, Ida. Anna and Clayton were born later, bringing the family to six beautiful children.<br><br>

	Dad grew up in a little town in New Mexico called Bluewater.   When he was nine, he helped Uncle Lee build a house for his bride.  They made the adobe bricks themselves.  Dad told me that it was awful work.  One day he decided he just didn�t want to work, so he found a place to hide.  Before too long, Uncle Lee came looking for him, and when he found him, he hauled him back to the house, and gave him a spanking for good measure.  As a kid, that story tickled me immensely because I just couldn�t imagine anyone spanking my Dad!  Perhaps that�s where he learned to work, for he was always involved in some kind of project. <br><br>
 
	For example: when he was sixteen, he decided that his mother needed indoor plumbing in her house.  I don�t know if he read a book to tell him how to do it, or if he just figured it out by himself (I suspect that), but he did it all.  I think that became his credo:  figure it out and do it yourself.  His high school (class of 1942) slogan said it a different way:  The door to success is labeled "push." <br><br>

	Dad went to high school in Grants, New Mexico, where he served as student body president his senior year.  Grandpa Hassell decided Dad was smart enough (after all, he had just plumbed his parents' house), so he asked Dad to quit school to go to work at the family sawmill.  Dad loved learning, and missed school horribly.  He was glad when grandpa finally allowed him to go back to school.  A few of the teachers didn�t want to let him back in, but the principal insisted.  Dad worked hard and was able to ace all his finals (except for one teacher, who, although Dad got a perfect grade, refused to give it to him on the grounds that he hadn�t earned it because he hadn�t been in class all year). <br><br>

	When Dad was 18, he had a job delivering milk each morning.  On the morning of his mother�s birthday, everyone he met was talking about a place called Pearl Harbor.  It was December 7th, 1941.   I asked him once what he remembered, about hearing the news on that day.  He said he had never heard of Pearl Harbor before, and was a little ashamed that he had no idea where it was. <br> <br>

	After graduating from high school, he and some his friends decided to enlist in the Army Air Corps.  They all made the trip to Albuquerque together, but only Dad passed all the exams.  So he entered by himself.  It was sure a different world from Bluewater, New Mexico!  <br><br>

	He was listed on the honor roll after his first 5 weeks of training.  He had classes like:  Aircraft & Principles of Flight, Navigation, and Engines & Propellers.   One of his flight instructors  wrote in his flight-training book:  "Retains instructions.  A levelheaded boy.  Will make a good pilot."   Dad got marked down, though, because he didn�t look around enough.  That doesn�t surprise me.  Dad always focused right in on his goal, and didn�t get sidetracked much.  <br><br>

	Training consisted of more than learning to fly a plane, however.  In preparation for what could happen on the trip overseas, he had to practice jumping 40 feet from the deck of a ship into the water, and learn to take off his trousers to use as a flotation device.  He said it was a terrifying experience to jump out into the dark.  <br><br>

	During this time, his mother wrote to him, urging him to start corresponding with Grace Whetten.  The Whetten family also lived in Bluewater.  Dad's father had grown up with Warren Whetten, my Mother�s father, in Mexico, so the families were close.  Grandma Hassell explained that Grace had broken up with a boyfriend and was feeling a little low.  So Dad started writing to her.  And she wrote back.  Before long Dad began thinking of her as more than just a friend.  When he came home on leave, that feeling blossomed, and he asked her to marry him.  She said yes, and ten days later they became husband and wife.  It caused quite a stir in Bluewater, as most people thought the two families were related and they were cousins.
When Dad's leave was over he took his bride back to El Paso, Texas. Once there, they found that Dad couldn�t get off the base, and the MPs wouldn�t let Mom get on.  So, Dad went back to his training and Mom went back to nursing school. <br><br> 

	Now, this part is my favorite story:  Dad got orders for the West Coast.  He had to report on base in San Rafael each day, but if his shipping orders hadn�t come through, he had the rest of the day to himself.  "I sure wish Grace were here," he thought, and wrote and suggested she come up.  She made arrangements and told him she�d be there on the next bus.  So Dad went down to the bus station in San Francisco to meet her, buying a gardenia from a street cart for a surprise.  She wasn�t on the bus.  So he went to the nearest hotel, The Pickwick Hotel, got a room, ran some water in the bathtub for the gardenia, and went back to the bus station to wait for the next bus, getting a fresh gardenia on the way.  She wasn�t on that one, either.  For three days, he went to the base each morning to check his orders, and then met every bus coming from New Mexico (getting a fresh gardenia each time, then adding it to the bouquet floating in the bathtub).  Finally, in desperation, he called home (he wasn�t supposed to do that).  They told him Mom was in San Francisco.  He was really worried, now, thinking about the girl from Bluewater lost in the big city.<br><br>

	He couldn�t afford to stay there indefinitely, however, so he decided to check out and go back to the base, and do his searching from there.  When he told them at the front desk that he hadn�t been able to find Grace Hassell, and he would be checking out, the woman there said, "Why, we have a Grace Hassell registered here in the hotel!" <br><br>
"I know," he replied, "I registered for both of us when I came."  <br><br>
"No," she answered, "This one is on the floor above, right over your room.  Do you want to use the telephone?"<br><br>
	Did he?!  <br><br>

Now, this is Mom's story:  she told Dad she would arrive by train.  When he wasn�t there to meet her, she got a room at the YMCA for the night.  There were two other girls there, and they talked her into sharing a room with them at a local hotel.  The Pickwick.  After three days, she decided that Dad had been shipped out, so she�d better return home.  She packed up her things, and was just walking out the door when the telephone rang.  She ignored it, thinking it was for one of the other two girls.  But before she closed the door, she changed her mind, went back into the room and picked up the receiver.<br><br>

	It was Dad.<br><br>

	Together at last, Mom and Dad (and an armful of gardenias) went up to San Rafael where they rented a room for themselves, not knowing how much time they would have together.  Every morning, Dad kissed Mom goodbye, and went back to the base to check his orders.  On the tenth day, Dad didn�t come back, so she knew he was leaving.  She went back to New Mexico.<br><br>

Dad said his group shipped out in full winter gear (in a plane, so he didn�t have to jump into the water after all, ) and ended up in the South Pacific.  The winter gear was just a ruse.  He flew B-24s in the Pacific Theater as a part of the 90th bomb group the "Jolly Rogers."  He was an "extra."  Whereas most crews trained together, and then flew together, he was part of a group of extra men, who were plugged into established crews.  He became a replacement for a co-pilot who walked away because of differences with the pilot.  The pilot was a nice enough fellow, but once in a while, he would go kind of crazy, and the co-pilot just couldn�t take it anymore.  The rest of the crew refused fly alone with the pilot.  So Dad became the buffer.  On the ground, he was assigned to serve as a bartender.  Because he made no secret of his religion, and because he obviously lived the way he professed, his commanding officers knew the bar and its content were safe with him.<br><br>

	I asked Dad how he felt when the war came to an end.  He said that at last he felt like could plan his life.  He felt it was finally safe to think about the future.  He and Mom went back to Bluewater.<br><br>

	Mom and Dad became an eternal family unit when they were sealed in the Mesa Temple on the 2nd of January, 1946.   Their family started to grow when Joyce was born in October of that year.  <br><br>

	When Joyce was six weeks old, Mom and Dad made a trip to Southern Oregon to visit Uncle Collins, who had married a girl from there.  Mom said that when Aunt Helen visited Bluewater, she would talk and talk about how beautiful it was back home in Oregon.  It really was pretty tiresome.  But, wouldn�t you know it, when Mom and Dad went there to visit, it was just as beautiful as she had said.  They never went back. Well, just to get their stuff to move.<br><br>

	They made their home in Ashland, Oregon.  Alan was born there, followed by Carolyn and Arlene, and then LaRee and Paula.  LaRee returned to her Heavenly Father when she was just a few days old.  Carolyn joined her in 1977, the result of injuries from an automobile accident.  We are sure they are rejoicing to have Dad with them now.<br><br>

	Dad supported his growing family by driving a logging truck.  He also went to school, graduating from Southern Oregon College in 1952.  He taught school at Walker Elementary School for a year, and then decided to go back to logging.  When he saw a need for a better log bunk, he designed and made it himself.  When other people started asking about buying them, he decided to sell his log truck to raise the capital he needed to go into the steel fabrication business.  There were some pretty lean years, but his perseverance (and Mom's faith in him) paid off.  His log bunks and stakes are still used on most logging trucks throughout California and the Northwest. <br><br>

	After 46 years in Ashland, Dad and Mom moved here to Sonora in 1992.  He built his own house, digging the foundation footings by hand, with precise, square corners.  We were not here when he put up his attic trusses.  By himself.  He rigged up a pulley in a neighboring tree, and used himself as a counterweight to ease them up, and had Mom hold each in place while he hammered nails. <br><br> 

	So you see why my Dad could fix anything.  If he didn�t have the right part, he would sit down, think a bit, and figure out a substitute.  I enjoyed working with him.  He talked to himself as he worked.  Sometimes he scolded himself.  Some times he congratulated himself.  Sometimes he just had a conversation with himself about the job he was working on.  And sometimes he just whistled. <br><br> 

	Dad liked to make things.  He was an inventor.  I can remember him and Uncle Collins playing out at the lake with a big saucer thing with a motor in the middle.  They also made a neat thing to take to the beach.  It looked kind of like a surfboard with a sail attached.  People call them sailboards, now, and you see folks out wind surfing on them.  But Dad and Uncle Collins were way ahead of that sport!<br><br>

	But favorite invention memory is of the swing.  A big swing.  A big swing made of steel tubing in a big triangle, hanging in a tree down by the shop.  With one person on each of the two bottom angles, standing and pumping, you could really get going.  Dad took it down after he almost killed Uncle Collins in an attempt to go all the way over.  But I remember it.  I asked him if we could make one for us, here.  He'd get this far away look in his eye, and he'd say, "That sure was a lot of fun, wasn't it!"
After Mom's illness and surgery 4 years ago, he learned to cook.  He was awfully proud of his apple pies!<br><br>

	Last year, Dad decided the bridge on our road was not going to last long.  So, he designed a new, stronger one.  And, under his leadership, the whole neighborhood got together and rebuilt it.  And we had a great time doing it!  Not only did he engineer a better bridge over Sullivan Creek, but he also engineered a better bridge between the people of Potato Ranch Road and Montgomery Road.<br><br>

  	However, Dad was not perfect.  He was a gadget junkie.  He loved gadgets.  He once bought one of those electronic mosquito repellers you wear like a watch, and then watched in disgust as the mosquitoes buzzed and then landed right on the repeller itself.  He bought a neat looking hair-cutting gizmo, that worked with a vacuum.  The vacuum pulled up your hair, so you (or someone close to you) could cut it evenly all around, all the same length.  Sounds good, right?  Didn't work.  But it made a neat noise! <br><br>

 	On the other hand, I remember when I was in high school, he brought home the first hand-held calculator Id ever seen.  Wow!  It could add and subtract. I think it could multiply and divide.   But that was all.  It cost only $100.  We were all amazed.<br><br>

	Dad loved the gospel of Jesus Christ.  He served in  many church positions, including more than 10 years as a counselor in the Klamath Falls, Oregon Stake and 10 years as the Stake President of the Medford, Oregon Stake.  He served 5 years as the Bishop of the Ashland 2md Ward, and 3 years as President of the Canada Halifax Mission.  When he was teaching early morning Seminary in 1975, he challenged his students to become part of the "consecutive club," by reading their scriptures every day.  He took on the challenge, too.  He and Mom read together, not missing a single day since then.  I don�t know how many times they read all four standard works: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.  He loved reading his scriptures.  He also enjoyed working in the Oakland Temple.  These last two years, I�ve had the great opportunity to travel down with him every Wednesday morning.  Not only did I have the great blessing of serving in the temple each week, but I had that 2 hours and 15 minutes in the car (each way) with Dad all to myself.  And he always bought me lunch. But  I would have still treasured those hours, even without the lunch.<br><br>

	I feel so very lucky to have had Mom and Dad living so close to us.  My children love them so much, and recognize the good example they have set.<br><br>

	My daughter Jenny could not come out.  This is the letter she sent me to read to him in the hospital.  It came too late.  So Id like to read it now, as I�m sure he is here with us...<br><br>
	
(Jenny's letter)<br><br>

	My parents have taught my brother and sisters me and to love our Heavenly Father, and our elder brother, Jesus Christ.  We know our Heavenly Father loves us, in spite of our many faults and mistakes, because we had an earthly father, Dennis Ray Hassell, who gave us that same kind of love.  We truly felt his unconditional love.  We can still feel it.  I�m grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ, that gives us the hope of being together again.  Dad did his part.  Now it�s up to us...<br><br>

	Mom, thanks for picking such a great man to be our father!<br><br>
