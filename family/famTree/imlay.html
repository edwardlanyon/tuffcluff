<center><b>JAMES HAVENS IMLAY </center></b><br>
 
James Havens Imlay was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day-Saints after just one meeting, by Elder Erastus Snow.  Then he journeyed together with his wife Anna across the plains to Salt Lake City, burying one daughter and having another born along the way.<br><br><br>


<center><b>ANNA ELIZA COWARD </center></b><br>
While journeying across the plains Anna Eliza Coward gave birth to daughter Margaret Nebraska Imlay.  A little more than two weeks after Margaret was born, her sister age one and a half years, died there on the plains.  They arrived in Salt Lake City and stayed there for quite some time, during which Anna had two more children.  Early in 1864 they were living in New Harmony, Utah, where her daughter, Keziah, was born.
