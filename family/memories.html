<center><b>"DIANA'S CLOSETS"</b><br>
By Scott Beal 2003</center><br>
<br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
My initial intent was to provide our extended family with a detailed description of the Deep South. Because it is such an interesting experience to live here, and because most of what you have heard about the South is true, I thought I could offer some firsthand observations. Then, Melanie gets this phone call from Daisha about a recent cleaning project. Mom's closets have been targeted for an overhaul.<br>
<br>
Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. This is certainly the case with Mom's closets. It is a compelling fact that no one, not even Mom, knows what is really in her closets. We can view the outer layers with relative ease, but no one has seen the inner sanctums for decades. It is a feast for the imagination.<br> 
<br><br>
<b>The Enigma Revealed</b><br>
Dad calls me into his room one day and says, "Scott, I have to show you something. You won't believe it unless you see it for yourself." He directs me to the rear wall of the room and draws back a Wal-Mart-four-square-yards-for-a-buck-material facade to reveal Mom's vast domain. He points to the two-foot section at the end of the closet that belongs to him. "See this," he says, "that's all I get. And look at this." He tries to pull out a suit, but it will not budge. "I have eight suits back there," he says, "and all my church shoes and shirts, my robe, my dress shirts and pants, it's all back there in that two-foot section. When I need something, I have to use a bigger two-by-four than Joseph Smith used to pry open the cement box at Cumorah. And that thing had been shut for almost two-thousand years!" Then, he moves to the left a little and says, "Check this out." With extreme difficulty, and this coming from a man who pushed heavy metal for 20 years, he moves Mom's collection of sequined crimson nighties to one side. "Look in there." I look and I'm stunned. Mom's collection is seven rods deep. I have no idea how she did that. I'm not even sure if it ends at seven rods deep. "WOW," I said. "How did she do that?" Dad just shakes his head and throws up his hands.<br>
<br>
I walk out of the room feeling sorry for Dad. But I'm also feeling a sense of admiration for Mom's capability to organize 30 years of thrift store bargains into such a small space. Dad goes outside, and I'm standing there fighting against a force that wants to draw me back into the room, back into that closet. I give way and go back in. I creep to the curtain thing and pull it back. I recognize a cheesy floral print, like my Grandma's divan. I get down on my hands and knees and lower my head. I plunge myself head first, straight forward, into the unknown. It gets more difficult the further I go. It is like a sensory buffet, but my eyes are closed. Finally, my head hits what appears to be the back wall. I feel around with my right hand and discover that it is not the wall at all. Well, it is a wall, but not a drywall wall. It is a wall made of shoeboxes, hundreds of them, as far up and as far back as I can reach. I realize it is no use to try to press forward without tools and a flashlight, so I back up.<br>
<br>
I stand up and take a careful look around Mom's room. The facades are everywhere, these makeshift storage units that house literally thousands of square yards of polyester, vinyl, and old leather. I realize that I am surrounded. I leave the room and walk down the hallway, only to discover more facades. Then, I check out the bedrooms. Yes, they are there, too. I enter the computer room and draw back a particularly cheerful drape of patterned purple burlap so that I can poke my head in, except that there is no room for my head. The closet, or whatever it is, is jammed with more of Mom's clothing. Astounding. So, I am thinking that the whole house is like a warehouse, with Mom's perpetual storage around every possible comer. It represents her personal history with thrift stores from around the globe. Then I think, "There has to be more. Why would Mom stop here?" <br>
<br>
I walk outside and into the barn. More storage. I open the motor homes. More storage. The vans, the attics, the shop, the boats, even the old goat-meat freezer chest; more storage. Then, horrified, I peer into Dad's tool cabinets, only to find that the tools are long gone and that the cabinets have been converted into shoe racks. I have never seen so many black boots. And then I find a pair of greenish-fuchsia, thigh-high gartered stilettos, with spurs and a slogan written across the side that reads, "Ride em', Nasty Cowgirl. " A closer look reveals a signature in faded but permanent black ink by "Anita Flores, your Hispanic hussy." Must have bought these in San Diego.<br>
<br>
From the far comer of the barn, a familiar image catches my attention. It is a steamer trunk. It is familiar because my own mother somehow pawned one of these things on Melanie before we moved. Now this ancient work of seafaring art sits at the foot of our bed and houses all those unsightly and uncomfortable afghans that my Grandmas knitted over the years before television. They also knitted to avoid having to sleep with their husbands, but that is another story. I walk over to the trunk and pry open the heavy lid. There is a label on top of a pile of cowboy paraphernalia that describes the chest's contents as Halloween costumes and birthday gifts. I rifle through the first layer and realize that experiencing Halloween in these costumes must have been pretty disappointing. Birthdays must have been even worse. Or, maybe Halloween was great because when homeowners saw the Cluff children wearing this crap, they recognized their sorry state of creative poverty and gave them even more candy. When Halloween charity was in short supply, the kids simply related an abridged story of scrambling for diesel-soaked potatoes, or traveling 180 miles for pomegranates, or eating Moms granola and wheat bread that had been baked in old cans. At least one of these stories must have worked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Family Group Therapy</b><br>
One day, Mom goes off to the store, and the rest of the family meets to discuss the issue. We decide to confront Mom, all of us, like other functional families do when their teenage kids are hooked on pot. I tell the family that I saw this work once on the Dr. Phil show. I know absolutely nothing about therapy, but having a doctoral degree qualifies the recipient to be persuasive, not intelligent. Persuasiveness goes a lot further in the real world. They all agree to confront Mom.<br>
<br>
Mom comes in from her shopping with her arms full of number 10 cans of Turkish goulash and tapioca pudding. We ask her to sit down in the center of the room. We confront her about the problem, thinking that it might be a real one, and she immediately unleashes a 31-minute stream of reasoning. "We've been commanded to have a year's supply of food. Well, I felt inspired to expand that directive to clothing, not just for our immediate family, but for Dane and his kids, Melanie and Scott, Edward's family in England, and the Southern portion of the city of Ashland. Just yesterday Dan Harris came by and found a sweater he liked. I had to show him where to look, and I didn't have my wig on. But Dan has seen your father and I naked anyway. He snuck up on us when we were in the hot tub one night. Both of us were asleep and the water had drained down below our knees. Dad's new halogen 2000-watt porch lights were pointed right on us. Anyway, he liked the sweater so he took it to give to his daughter who is at school in Virginia and it is so cold there and she can't afford to buy a good jacket even though Dan makes good money from his Ashland judge job. Dad should have been a judge. Anyway, Dan usually calls now before he comes over for clothes, but he has several children who LOVE Nial's old clothes and the twins' old clothes. His daughter wore the sweater on a date and her boyfriend loved it and asked where she got it and she told him it was from an old barn in Ashland where her dad gets clothes for free. The next time she visits for a break she is going to bring her boyfriend and I told Dan to tell him that he can look through all the clothes in the bam and find whatever he wants to take back to Virginia. But he can't sell anything unless he lets me see what he's taking to sell first. It might fit one of the boys."<br>
<br>
Daisha and Tiana remind Mom about how the contents of only one small portion of one small closet covered all 17 couches, and that the piles were over their heads. Mom remains unmoved. Dad suggests that over the years his own personal storage space has been reduced steadily as a result of Mom's obsession. Still no reaction from Mom. Melanie reminds Mom that her husband Scott wants to purchase the Hispanic hussy's boots, and that he can't take his eyes off of the migrant farmer women while driving through central California. Mom says I can name the price, and then emerges from her chair unscathed. She goes into the kitchen and proceeds to make space for the cans. "I can't remember if it was from the April 2002 General Conference or HGTV," she says, ".. .anyway, as we approach the end of the world, it will be really hard to find women's clothing, especially formal wear, and this type of clothing will be worth 20 times more than it is now because no one will have any and everyone already LOVES my clothing and they always ask where I shop and I tell them I shop at Good Will and they can't believe it, but if you coordinate your colors and styles and use shoulder pads with everything you can look really nice, like a movie star. I saw the homo decorator cut pieces of silk from women's lingerie and use it to cover several vases and his homo friend scored it on a scale from one to ten, one being scary and ten being good enough to convert Alec Baldwin to total gayness. I used to never buy lingerie from the thrift store until Shira announced that she and her boyfriend were getting married and then I thought she might like something nice for the honeymoon but she said no and I told her that she needed to be more positive and wash it three times really good before she wears it and that all men like it. She cut her hair short after I told her to let it grow long, like Melanie's used to be." I was the only one left in the living room by the time Mom finished.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>An Empirical Approach</b><br>
The scientific method is just one way of acquiring knowledge. Frankly, it is an overrated and terribly inefficient means of knowing anything, in spite of what Randy thinks. The average researcher's time-line for discovery is about ten years, unless he or she works for a pharmaceutical company, in which case profit and product are more important than public safety. Hence, the FDA. Most of the great discoveries were made by accident, and almost none of them were made by researchers.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, most researchers have the luxury of plodding along the marble path while the world's problems come and go, sharing results with each other and arguing over procedures and ideas that have little basis in practical reality. Historically, research had nothing to do with anything practical or real anyway. It was just for fun, or for stimulating the mind, or required for future funding. As a researcher, I wanted to be different. I wanted to make my mark on the scientific world. I wanted to change the course of humanity. And if I could not accomplish these goals, I wanted a really good medical and dental plan because when you feel crappy, or when your tooth aches, the rest of the human race means nothing.<br>
<br>
Mom's closets represent an interesting problem, and an interesting problem is where really amazing empirical research begins. I decide to accept the challenge. I design my evaluation plan, acquire the necessary governmental permission to use human subjects, buy all the appropriate metrics and measurement equipment, and set up my lab just to the left of Mom and Dad's bed. There is really no room over there, so I decide to use the drawers under their bed to house my equipment, but I can't get them open. I brace my feet against the sideboards and my back against the wall. I grab the handle with both hands and pull like mad. The drawer opens about one inch, and then the handle breaks off in my hands. I look for a crow bar, and then find one, amazingly.
I still cannot get the drawer open. I can just see the compressed shoulder pads bulging and ready to explode from the open crack in the drawer. I kick the drawer closed with my feet to avoid the blast, and decide to submit to the constraints of the experimental setting.<br>
<br>
With my tools in a pack on my back, 72 ounces of Accelerade, and four Power Bars in my pocket, I make my way to the material facade behind the bed. I approach the point of no return with trepidation. My thoughts are with the pioneers. This is what they must have felt like before they left with the Willie handcart company in the middle of that fateful winter. At least I will be alone in there. I won't be able to resort to cannibalism. I always thought that if I were traveling to a dangerous place, with little prospect of a safe return, I would take the friend that gets the least amount of exercise, and some barbeque sauce.<br>
<br>
I make my way beyond the first few levels, and then find the shoebox wall. I light my lantern and turn on my carbon monoxide detector. I begin pulling down shoeboxes and stacking them behind me. I smell urine. Have the twins been back here? Then I find two empty sardine cans and a Victoria's Secret Magazine. It is an issue from the late 1970s. Lots of shoulder pads and shiny vinyl. I make it passed the shoeboxes and find another four layers of clothes, most of which are from the 60s. I see hip hugger corduroy bell-bottoms and peace signs and Jimi Hendrix memorabilia. I see a photograph of Elvis with a jelly donut and a handful of Quaaludes. He's wearing an orange scarf and a white sequined jump suit. He has sweat streaming down his face as he belts out the final verse of "In the Ghetto." I find boxes filled with Dad's old country western albums and his Louis L'Amour novels, the leather-bound collection. Wow, he thought those were long gone.<br>
<br>
Then, I find Mom's secret hide-a-way, her safe deposit box. The door on the box is slightly ajar. I hesitate, and then scan my conscience. I wrestle with the ethical dilemma of the find of the century and the feeling that I am invading precious territory. But then I remember that this is science, and that I will do anything for the good of science and my own shameless self-promotion. I'm back on track. I reach into the box and pull out what appears to be a diary. I open the first page and read the inscription. Mom writes, "The following is an accurate account of all my life-after-death experiences. I was allowed to return to Earth to record them for posterity, and for the betterment of mankind, especially the medical profession." I strap my forehead flashlight on and begin reading. The first chapter is titled "The Virtues of Garlic and Vaseline." Apparently, they use the stuff in the Spirit World, but only in the Paradise section, and not in the Spirit Prison section. The Spirit Prison section is reduced to most modern medicines only. No herbs allowed. Although, when real medical problems arise in Paradise, they immediately seek assistance from the Prison section.<br>
<br>
The next four chapters deal with the spiritual awakening of the Australian Aborigines, how Mom dwelt among them before her reincarnation as an American, and basic home decor on a tight budget. The final chapter describes Mom's experience with her aneurysm, her visit to the Celestial Kingdom for 14 minutes, and then her reasons for returning, which were to help Dad manage the rodent problem and the finances. She describes an after life of peace and rest, where all soda bottles are twist-off and casseroles always taste fresh. In this world the twins can take care of themselves without breaking anything, Shira drops her boyfriend and graduates Summa Cum Laud from BYU Idaho and marries an OBGYN, everyone vacuums with their cloths on, garlic grows by the side of gold gilded streets, everyone finds true joy and happiness in Mom's herbal concoctions, and best of all, and without exception, all the women get their eternal clothes from Mom. Her closet is resurrected along with the rest of humanity, not in the first resurrection, which upsets some women who had been waiting, but during the transition into the Millennium. Billions of women, except Aunts Bev and Judy, stand in long lines, waiting patiently for their chance to see, feel, and then own one of Mom's articles of clothing. Eventually, all celestial women are dressed in the eternal glory of shoulder pads and faux furs from Mom's closets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Back on earth, Mom and Dad are eventually crowded out of the house. They take up residence in Grandma Anna's cottage with the stipulation that everything that comes into it has to be checked by Janos. Mom sneaks Goodwill bags in while Janos is busy chasing off Eddie Babcock. Dad is upset that the motor homes and boats have to stay behind to house Mom's clothes, but he understands the importance of the sacrifice, as do the rest of us.<br>
<br>
I submitted my report of the evaluation to The Journal of Obsessive Compulsive Behavior. I was scheduled to appear on the Dr. Phil show, but was later rejected for promoting exercise and for criticizing the Atkins diet. In the meantime, Mom continues to collect. She views it as a proxy service for those women in the Spirit World who can no longer collect for themselves, knowing that one day, her service will payoff with glorious dividends. Her children pretty much know what they'll get for an inheritance. <br>

<center><b>"THE BARN"</b><br>
By Scott Beal 2002<br></center>
<br>
<b>PART I</b><br>
The family barn is of divine origin. Moses had a barn, Abraham had a barn, and Enoch and his people were taken up to heaven in guess what? A barn. Noah had a floating barn, hundreds of barns were torn down to build the tower of Babel, and the great and spacious building started out as a barn before the developers implemented their own delusions. However, and let me be perfectly Francis; no one on earth has ever had a barn that even begins to approach Mom and Dad's barn. Theirs is the quintessential barn that surpasses all knowing, all seeing, and all believing, as well as all storing, all humidifying, and all smellifying. Thus, the story begins with an exciting and new business venture, and a few grateful hippies.<br>
Thousands of fishermen passed by the barn on the way to the mountain lakes every day. The conclusion to cash in by selling a really choice piece of Ashland pine forest at a greatly underestimated price, and then to use the money to raise night crawlers was logical enough. No one could argue that great profits were in store, except maybe Mom who imagined her fingernails filled with mud, and many morning hours of scooping worms into bait buckets for foul men who arrived early enough to see her in her nightgown. That sexy outfit sold a lot of worms.<br>
Unfortunately, the nightcrawler craze passed as quickly as the Emu craze, or the Angora goat craze, or Dick Shumway's construction business. However, worms were still high in demand, not for their ability to lure the lunker bass, but for their ability to produce the perfect soil supplement for growing killer buds. Pot-smoking hippies from all over the Northwest gathered at the barn for a most precious commodity that only slimy, uni-sexed creatures from the semi-dark and deep could produce: Wormturd. It was an instant hit. Yet, mom's conscience was pricked. She complained to Dad that it was not ethical for Mormons to sell aids for illegal substances in any form. Even when Dad explained that marijuana was being tested as a cancer treatment, and that all their hippy customers were the pilot-test group, Mom did not budge. So, from that time forward Dad required that anyone who purchased wormturd had to show proof of fishing as a hobby. In a single day Wal-mart was depleted of its stock of Zebco 202 children's fishing combo packages. Some hippies, who bought wormturd in relatively large quantities to support their vast mountain groves, even purchased small aluminum boats with trailers just for show. How could Mom argue with that? Still, something was fishy, or not fishy, as the case may be.<br>
Then, the Paraquat scare of the late seventies hit the marijuana market. Cops in helicopters with infrared scanners sprayed the chemical on dope plants all over the Northwest Territory. Smoking marijuana laced with Paraquat resulted in severe inflammation of the gall bladder and a desire to dress like Carol Channing. Die-hard pot heads carried Preparation-H and saffron umbrellas, and broke into song (usually show tunes) after a few bong tokes. Hippies too embarrassed for such display transformed their outdoor plantations into indoor ones. Many farmers turned soil-based operations into hydroponic productions. Alcohol sales skyrocketed, and the demand for wormturd died in the fight against the evils of hemp. Dad mentioned that the barn could be transformed into a distillery, for medicinal purposes only, of course. The kids loved the idea, but Mom would have none of it. Thus, the barn began another transformation.<br>
Steven Hawking, the great quadriplegic physicist, wrote a book that discussed, in great detail, the rotations of the known galaxies. He stated that as the universe contracts, stars are drawn together by gravity into spinning clusters. After billions of years the stars that make up these clusters draw close enough to form shapes, like swirls of light in the sky. Eventually, the stars will draw close enough to collide and explode, causing multiple super-novas that will, in turn, cause another universal expansion.<br> 
Mom read Steven Hawking's book and applied its truths to barn science. Thrift store goods were likened unto the stars of the universe. These goods were rotated from people's closets and garages to boxes, then to the trunks of their cars, then to Goodwill or D.I. drop offs, then into large brown bags with one-dollar-a-bag tags on them, then into shopping carts, and then finally placed strategically in areas inside thrift stores. Mom went shopping, bought all the sale bags, then put them into the van, then into the house, then on the floor of the living room, then into sorted piles. About five percent of the items went into her closet after pockets were checked for cash, then three percent were set aside for birthday gifts, Christmas gifts, and Halloween costumes. The rest were rotated into the barn.<br>
After several years of this rotation process, the barn began to simulate an actual galaxy, though not much light was seen. But explosions were inevitable. A dreaded super-nova made up of food storage from the Disco era, moth balls, starling nests, oil drained from the motor home, and Mom's vast collection of thrift store goods was on the horizon. The boys had been draining their lizards in the barn for years, which added up to ammonia fumes. Even members of the extended family recognized the virtues of rotating goods (bads, really) into the fray. For example, although difficult to imagine, judging from the clothes he wore at family functions, Uncle Bob stored his Cabana wear in the barn, along with his Miracle Ear sales information, and his forensic make-up and styling guides. They were nothing but fodder for the flame and fury to come.<br>
<br>
<b>PART II</b><br>
Thanksgiving and Christmas are wonderful times of the year for Mormon men. We get to sit back, enjoy rest from work, enjoy the presence of extended family, watch football, and observe the women prepare, serve, and clean up everything. I have no idea who started this tradition, but I am absolutely sure it was not a woman. The doctrine can be traced back to Eve being the first to partake of the apple, and then to Adam's keen sense of blame when he stated, "The woman thou <b>gavest</b> me, she prepared a casserole of forbidden fruit, and I did eat." The pattern dates back to antiquity.<br> 
Recognizing that woman's work lies in the preparation of all holiday events, Mom convinced Dad to purchase a freezer chest for the barn. One day each year Mom prepared sixty pounds of assorted casseroles and fruit jubilees for use during the holiday season and packed them into the freezer. Then, human nature got the best of the entire family. There is an old Yiddish proverb that states that given any amount of extra space, Americans will fill it up with a vengeance. (Mom's closets are representative examples of the idea.) Word of freezer space spread quickly (telegram, telephone, telewoman). While Mom relished in her frozen relish, other relatives snuck their own creations into the freezers until the lids could not be closed properly. Dad butchered a goat, a pig, and then purchased half a cow, which created the immediate need for another freezer chest. In short order, both freezers were way beyond their carrying capacity.<br>
Being placed strategically, just inside the barn door, meant that the freezers were in close proximity to the house. Retrieval of any freezer item could be made with relative ease. However, freezers need electrical power to operate, and the closest outlets could only be activated with extension cords. On one of their late afternoon excursions into the barn to potty, the boys tripped over the cords and cut off the supply of electricity to both freezers. It was hot in July, and the thawing process took no prisoners. Two days went by before Dad noticed the problem. Upon opening one freezer lid, he recognized very quickly that three upper levels of casserole had infused into one level. In panic mode, Dad opened the lid to the meat freezer, only to discover that the family's most precious commodity had softened, and then congealed. Pained with the loss, Dad hung his head and made his way back to the house to spread the bad tidings to the rest of us. As with all undesirable events, Mom's perpetual optimism shined through like a ray from the sun. "Oh, Dennis. Don't throw any of it away," she retorted. "Just plug the freezers back in and the food will be fine. After it's frozen again, we can invite all of our extended family to come and pick up their food, which will uncover our food at the bottom of the freezers." This sounded logical and reasonable to us. The word "botulism" never made its way to the surface, but I am certain that some of us were pondering the possibility.<br>
Three days later the family gleaning of freezer goods began. Bob took more than his share, including any package with a meat label. LaVona packed her food into large coolers, and then distributed cupcakes to everyone. Rex and Jerry never showed up. Monte came by with a video camera to record the event. Ray Hassell received a revelation to stay home that day. Grandma Anna spent two frustrating hours digging for her frozen humus-flavored tofu, but to no avail. The twins had pinched it weeks earlier, thinking it was ice cream. There was no mention by those in the know about the loss of electrical power. However, the evidence of the loss manifested itself throughout the subsequent holiday season. Never before had so many family members complained of nasty winter viruses that seemed to take hold on Thanksgiving and Christmas day. Once more the barn scored a justifiable victory.<br>
<br>
<b>PART III</b><br>
Any tow truck worth its weight in straw owns and uses dollies built by Dad and Dane. Their dolly production made the barn famous. Yet, the barn still retained a split personality. One end housed a multitude of heavy equipment and machinery, along with the floor upon which Dane performed his daily "Dance-of-20-sets," so often copied, but never duplicated. People from miles around, including hippies still searching for wormturd, came and watched Dane and Dad produce the best dollies in the universe. (Only NASA scientists knew that the space shuttle used Dad's dollies to tow the Meir space station.) On the other side of the barn, remnants from the search for the ultimate thrift store bargain continued to transform its internal architecture. Abandoned leech lines from the old septic system that ran underneath the barn gave it an explosive quality. Left-behinds from a once flourishing crepe-cart manufacturing business occupied another comer. And four decades of food supply were still housed in a secret room that only the O'Reilly children could break into.<br>
The trees and shrubs planted by Mom to hide the beastly structure did what they were intended to do. Decisions as to what to do with the barn weighed heavily on Dad's mind. Renting out space seemed appropriate, but only temporary. The day that the bam was to be demolished was not far distant, until Mom found a long-lost manuscript in the shoulder of a fur coat she bought at Goodwill.<br>
In 1849, Samuel Brannon, whose wife had an insatiable appetite for high quality beaver fur, was convinced to take a shipload of Saints to California instead of to Utah as Brigham Young had counseled. Brannon was an ambitious man, and was convinced that a purposeful miscalculation of the compass would land his party on the shores of British Columbia, where the biggest beavers could be trapped, butchered, and converted to formal wear. The Saints, he predicted, would be so weary from the horrible journey (compare Ingmar Bergman's "The Emigrant Saga") that upon arriving on the shores of Canada, they would be willing to perform any labor that delayed the re-boarding of that ship. At first, his predictions were accurate. However, the trapping of beaver proved to be much more difficult than he had imagined. One full-length fur coat was all that Brannon salvaged from months of trapping. The Saints, now more willing than ever to be obedient to Brigham's directions, convinced Brannon to set sail again for California, where they could head due east and meet up with the migrating Mormon pioneers. Brannon himself was weary of the beaver trade, but his wife's appetite for fur had not been met.<br>
"Sam, " she begged, "if this is the will of Heaven, that we leave these beautiful shores, then ask that it be made known to me. For I long to wear the multitude of blessings from beaver, and yet I have only one cloak in which to reside. "<br>
"Fear not, my love, " Samuel responded. "I will inquire. "<br>
Brannon inquired, and the revelation was received. Brannon's wife acted as scribe as he dictated the revelation word for word. She wrote on a large scroll of beaver leather, and then promptly lost it. Brannon, known for his difficulty with transferring the events of short-term memory into long-term memory, attempted to write the revelation again, but could not remember a single sentence, which is typical for most Mormon husbands. Impatient to the point of hostility,
the Saints stripped Brannon's wife of her beaver coat, threw she and Brannon into the ship's hold and set sail for the Gold Coast.<br>
Upon arriving in San Francisco harbor, the ship, along with most of its goods, was confiscated by the company who owned it. Brannon, in his ambition to get rich from the beaver trade, lost everything and was reduced to rags and wandering the harbors of the bay. When his emaciated body was found, it was wrapped in his wife's beaver fur coat, which was stolen from him, and then later donated to a local thrift store.<br>
One-hundred and ninety years later, during one of their trips to the Oakland temple, Mom managed to convince Dad that Frisco had the best thrift stores in the country. Dad conceded, and Mom and Dad carted home seventy-five pounds of vintage clothing.<br>
Sorting through the clothes was Mom's next task. Much to her surprise, she came across a really nice fur coat. She tried it on, but noticed immediately that the shoulder pads had to be removed. She took a pair of scissors to the seams and yanked out what appeared to be some sort of leather that had been stuffed in the coat's shoulders. The leather fell to the ground, only to open up and reveal its written contents. Mom picked up the scroll and read the revelation given to Brannon's wife. It stated, in no uncertain terms, that the site for the Temple of New Jerusalem at Independence Missouri had been changed, and that the new site was "...at the place of the barn, in Siskiyou County, in the State of Oregon."<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
All things for the barn have changed since the lost manuscript was found. It still houses the humble belongings of a righteous Mormon family, along with other substances that science has yet to identify. Yet, it has become somewhat of a sacred shrine, a symbol of a coming of age, a spiral galaxy of sorts. It is a landmark from which all bearings are taken, where all priorities are adjusted and confirmed, where all birthday presents find their origin. It serves to focus our thoughts and concentrate our minds, as well as our memories. For those of us in the family who have since moved away, the memory of the barn is a bastion of stability in a chaotic world where nothing is certain. And when it is time for the barn to be razed to make way for a better structure, we will look on with awe, and remember the day the food thawed, and then froze again. We will remember when Bob stole the goat meat by mistake and took it to a semi-formal dinner party and offered it as the main dish. We will remember the sound of the compressor, and the sounds of Curtis negotiating contracts with Francy. We will praise the Buffalo machine that never cut off any of Dad's fingers, even when he fell asleep while cutting heavy metal. Most of all, we will remember a time when things were simple, yet profound. We will remember when twenty-seven adults and children shared one overworked commode. We will remember that the best things, the worst things, and everything in between, were once housed under the auspicious roof of that wonderful structure we call THE BARN.<br>

<center><b>PAINT YOUR BARN</b><br>
By Tiana Johnson 1995<br></center>
<br>
Most mothers in this world are concerned that their daughters are wearing too much makeup. On an average morning a girl may walk downstairs, nervously looking to the left, then to the right, then over her shoulder. When it looks as if there's no one around, she bolts toward the front door at top speed. Just as she opens the door to quietly slip out, she hears her mother bellow her name. She turns around, her head drooping down on her chest to hide the eye shadow and lipstick she had generously applied only moments before, but her mother sees the makeup and demands that her daughter march upstairs to blot and wipe. Now this scenario only happens in most normal households, but my house is anything but normal. When I go out, I turn my head away
from my mother as I rush past her, but she always stops me and tells me to show her how I look. When I display myself, she nods approvingly, then she throws in her suggestions. A typical advice session would sound like this; "You really should put on more blush, and more lipstick would make you look like a superstar. While you're at it, darken your eyes. Adding more makeup is like painting your barn. It'll improve your overall appearance." 
If I don't go back into my room and follow her instructions, she brings out her colorful makeup palette. I don't have anything against makeup; I'm very thankful for it. I just believe in moderation. Some girls would probably say I should be grateful that my mom allows makeup, but I suggest that they come live at my house, then they'll be cured of their passion for pigment.<br>

<b>"The Only Commode"</b><br> 
By Scott Beal<br>
<br>
My story starts quite nicely,<br> 
when I was white and new,<br> 
I sat upon the discount shelf<br>
with other porcelain pews.<br>
<br>
My price was low,<br>
my shine was bright.<br>
Yet, every single day,<br>
the wealthy shoppers passed me by<br>
and looked the other way.<br>
<br>
How sad I was just waiting there,<br>
an unfulfilled commode.<br>
With all the others purchased,<br>
my purpose put on hold.<br>
<br>
Until that gloried fateful day,<br>
that family oh, so dear!<br>
Who went out hunting for a deal<br>
and found me wanting here.<br>
<br>
They took me home<br> 
and hooked me up,<br>
and let the waters flow.<br>
And flushed with smiling faces,<br>
and rear-ends all aglow.<br>
<br>
My purpose finally brought to pass,<br>
a measure of my pride,<br>
at last I fought the evil waste<br>
and ebbed the gruesome tide!<br>
<br>
I worked with fury day and night,<br>
and sought no respite there.<br>
But felt the future weight I'd hold<br>
with talk of commune in the air.<br>
<br>
They came in droves,<br>
more Cluffs and Beals,<br>
more buns than I had ever seen.<br>
And young ones with their shameful aim,<br>
Mom suffered long to keep me clean.<br>
<br>
So many flushes,<br>
so little time,<br> 
and when the leech line slowed,<br> 
my vengeance came from underneath,<br>
my wrath did overflow.<br>
<br>
The brand new room,<br>
they'd worked so hard<br>
to give their house more space.<br>
But in their haste,<br>
they built the floor<br>
atop my stinky place.<br>
<br>
Their dinners had a new perfume,<br>
their guests would turn and run.<br>
Until Mom finally had enough,<br>
and Dad found out what must be done.<br>
<br>
He dug a trench<br>
both long and wide<br>
to help me with my plight.<br>
And forged ahead,<br>
amidst the stench,<br>
and vowed to set it right.<br>
<br>
For old line out,<br> 
and new line in,<br> 
their savings they did spend.<br>
And ended my disruptive reign,<br> 
a foe again a friend.<br>
<br>
And now I flush with perfectness,<br> 
I've mended all relations.<br>
A grand ole' toilet I've become<br>
and filled the measure of my creation.<br>
<br>
Yet, soon I'll face<br>
my hardest task,<br>
not death, to my chagrin.<br>
I'll spend all my remaining days<br>
beneath those feisty twins!<br>

<b>"'Twas the Night Before the Cluff Christmas"</b><br>
by The Cluff Kids<br>
<br>
'Twas the night before Christmas, and the Cluff house was quiet,<br>
Except for the twins, who were causing a riot.<br>
The stockings were hung, too close to the fire,<br>
Causing something to smell, like an old burning tire.<br>
<br>
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
With waterproof sheets, and gum stuck to their heads;<br>
And mom with her scriptures, and dad in a nap,<br>
Had just settled down, for a conference re-cap. <br>
<br>
When all of a sudden, there arose such a clatter,<br>
Mom ran to the kitchen, to see what was the matter.<br>
Away down the hall, she flew like a flash,<br>
Tripped over the vacuum, and came down with a crash.<br>
<br>
The moon on the crust of the old-plastic floor,<br>
Made it look like no one had swept it before,<br>
When, what to mom's wondering eyes should emerge,<br>
But a big, nasty rat and eight massive rat herds.<br>
<br>
With a foaming rat snarl, they lunged for her face, <br>
Ten thousand mad-rats; one massive rat race.<br>
Attacking like eagles, the rats all gave chase,<br>
Mom whistled and shouted, to wake the whole place;<br>
<br>
"Now, DENNIS! now, DALLAS! now, WESTON! and SOREN!<br>
On, NIAL! on, HYRUM! on, SHIRA! and AMMON!<br>
To the top of the roof! to the top of the wall!<br>
Now run away! run away! run away all!"<br>
<br>
So the kids all woke up, and all went berserko,<br>
But the rats were relentless and began to encircle.<br>
So up to the house-top the Cluffers they flew,<br>
All in their nightclothes, without any shoes.<br>
<br>
And then, in a twinkling, they heard something dire;<br>
The gnashing and clawing of rats climbing higher!<br>
In one giant leap, the Cluffs flew to the ground,<br>
But right on their tails came the rats like blood-hounds!<br>
<br>
The big rat caught up with our mother real quick,<br>
He cornered poor mom, and she gave him a kick,<br>
But he was a tough, mean and nasty old git,<br>
So one little kick didn't hurt him a bit.<br>
<br>
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his rump,<br>
His body was covered with scars, cuts and bumps;<br>
Millions of rat traps he dodged in his life.<br>
(He looked like he'd lost every fight with his wife!)<br>
<br>
His eyes--how they glowered! His whiskers how scary!<br>
His lips were curled up, and his tail was quite hairy!<br>
His body was scabby, right down to his toes,<br>
And his nasty rat teeth were as yellow as...snow;<br>
<br>
Then he closed in on mom, and he stunk like a skunk,<br>
She yelled to the others, "A rat with a FUNK"!<br>
She covered her nose, then suggested shampoo  <br>
Then giggled a little and said, "Sorry, but true".<br> 
<br>
With a twitch in his eye, and a bulging neck vein,<br>
The rat grit his teeth...and then went insane!  <br>
Like a demon he let out a growl filled with dread,<br>
Which gave mom to know, that he wanted her dead;<br>
<br>
Then from a deep slumber, our DAD did awake<br>
With the midnight munchies, in search of some cake.<br>
He spied the old rat, ready to pounce on his wife,<br>
And sprung into action, to save our mom's life.<br>
<br>
The rat saw him coming--a sight oh so chilling--<br>
For he knew the legend of Dennis's rat killing);<br>
One shot with a handgun, sprayed o'er the wall,<br>
One spun in the washer, one chucked like a ball.<br>
<br>
The rat stood there frozen, aquiver with fear,<br>
While dad drew in closer, until he was near.<br>
Dad seized the fat rat and squeezed it quite tightly,<br>
A plan he was forming, with results quite unsightly!<br>
<br>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
And spun the rat 'round by the tail with a jerk.<br>
Then spinning the nasty rat higher and higher,<br>
Dad opened the woodstove, and stoked up the fire;<br>
<br>
And into the fiery furnace dad flung,<br>
The big stinking rat--followed by all his rat chums.<br>
But the fat rat exclaimed, as he set all-alight,<br>
"BURNED-RAT STENCH IS ETERNAL, IT WILL HAUNT YOU EACH NIGHT!"<br>

<br>
<b>1962</b>
<b>In The Beginning...</b><br>
Dennis Cluff was raised in Arizona but when he was on a mission in Norway his family moved to Ashland, Oregon. When Dennis returned from his mission in 1962 it was to a new town. Soon after coming home he was attending church and happened to see a beautiful local girl sitting near the front. Her name was Diana. She saw him too. When church ended, Dennis and Diana waited patiently for someone to introduce them but that wasn't happening so they covertly began to edge ever closer together hoping to "accidentally" bump into each other.<!---

Eventually they met (need more detail!!) they dated for a few months and while on a date watching dad�s mission slides, mom was inspired to marry him. (more info) They dated for 9 months? altogether before deciding to tie the knot.
Engagment:
The legacy of the Dennis Cluff family all started with a proposal at Pebble beach. Or was it Harris beach? Dennis insists that he asked Diana to marry him at Harris Beach in Brookings, but for years Diana insisted that it was Pebble Beach in Crescent City. Nearly 40 years later, the debate has finally been settled, and the winner is...Dad! "It was Harris Beach," Dad says triumphantly. "I can take you to the very spot today, and have done so with Mom on more than one occasion. What she remembers is the Senior Skip Day we went on with a bunch of kids to Crescent City--but that is not the place I proposed to her. It was Brookings." Mom admits she was wrong, "It was Brookings. We were lying on a blanket in swimming suits by a big pile of driftwood. The Oregon coast is always cloudy, foggy, windy and freezing--but we were so in love, the weather didn't bother us a bit. Dad had just finished rubbing suntan lotion on my back when he asked me to marry him. My body must have turned him on as I was a trained ballerina and had been dancing since I was eight. Now, 40 years on, my body has bit the dust."

<b>Vacations</b><br>
<img src="Pictures/beaver.jpg" align=left>In the early stages of Mom and Dad's marriage, it was considered very chic to own one of those newfangled campers that mounted on the back of a pick-up truck. So Mom and Dad decided to buy one and--two campers and three motorhomes later--they've never looked back. Camping and travelling in the motorhome has become one of our oldest and least respected family traditions. Motorhoming the Cluff way is anything but traditional. Instead of parking in a specifically dedicated RV park, the Cluff's sleep in parking lots.<br>
