<img src='Pictures/drufall5.jpg' align=left><b><u>DID YOU KNOW?</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>Dru loves Cage</b> and would rather spend time playing with Cage than doing anything else.  Her favorite game is being chased by "Cage the Monster" and will squeal and try to run when Cage is after her.  She redefines soprano.  She has learned to "run away" and change direction when she realizes her path is blocked.  She will crawl underneath legs or any other bridge type object to get away from Cage.  When it seems Cage has lost interest, Dru will come up to her and growl to instigate the game again.  It's wierd.<br>
<br>
<b>At the beach</b> Dru gets really exited as soon as she can hear the waves.  She likes to play in the sand, walk on the beach and stick her legs in the water.  She's not up for the dunking yet.  She will sit for hours watching the sea gulls and pelicans fly around and dive in the waves.<br>
<br>
<b>Dru is learning Spanish</b> at daycare and she understands questions and phrases enought to pick up the right toy when asked.  In English she knows the names of her family members and other words like snake, bird, book, water, bottle, cat and dog etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Our neighbors</b> have a pretty "Griswald-ish" display of Halloween decorations next door and whenever Dru can see any Halloween decoration, she always says "Ahh Haa Haaa!" as if she were the count on Sesame Street.  It's kind of spooky!<br>
