<br>
<b><u>TALEA'S FAVORITES</u></b><br><img src='Pictures/taljam.jpg' align=left>
<b>Favorite Food</b> -  Most fruits and vegetables, especially grapes, pronounced �bapes�. She adores the grapevine that�s growing over the neighbor�s fence. Any time she sees it she gets excited, points, and says �bapes!!� She does NOT like bread. Oh, how can I forget red licorice!! She goes wild over that. Hyrum goes to great lengths to make sure that she gets addicted to his addictions, such as licorice, M&M�s, ice cream, brownies and rootbeer. She knows the round licorice container, so even if it�s empty, she�ll find it and search it thoroughly for any scraps left behind.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Breakfast</b> - Bapes! (grapes), blackberries and yogurt.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Dessert</b> - Bapes! or anything loaded with sugar (ice cream, etc. You know, Daddy�s little girl.)<br> 
<br>
<b>Favorite Drink</b> - I know it�s terrible that she drinks pop already, but rootbeer or any pop we�re drinking is what she dies for (rootbeer is Hyrum�s choice for pop, and he�s the one who usually buys the stuff). Hyrum made sure she developed a taste for his favorite treats at an early age so she�d be Daddy�s little girl. Actually, she had a berry smoothie from Costco the other day that she fought tooth and nail to keep to herself, so that might even win over pop. Orange juice and milk are close runner-ups.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Books</b> - Any kids �bups�(books) that have real pictures in them of babies, animals, foods, and balls. �Baby Words� is a particular favorite. She�s really gotten into books, so if she sees one, she grabs it and forces you to stop what you�re doing and read it to her. She loves to listen to you make the animal sounds, but she�s good at them herself too. The �itsy bitsy spider� is her current favorite book. She sings �bitsy, bitsy� as she turns the pages and points at pictures, then she makes the sounds of the animals in the book.<br>

<br>
<b>Favorite Authors</b> - Anyone who will publish real pictures of animals, toys, or kids.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite School Subject</b> - Well, she�s not in school, but she loves looking at books and identifying the pictures. Exploration 101 has got to be it.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Computer Games</b> - �What are those?� says Tilly. �Never seen one before.�<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Color</b> - She hasn�t shown a preference for one yet, although she�s partial to Barney�s Rainbow of Colors book, unfortunately. She�s also obsessed with her lavender coat. She saw it at the store and wouldn�t take it off all day once she put it on.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Toys</b> - Baby dolls! She makes a crying sound for them, then puts a rag on them for a blanket and rocks them back and forth. Bracelets are a close second favorite. She stacks them up on her arm like the 80�s.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Music</b> - She loves it when I sing the Girl�s Camp favorite �Shining Water� to her, and she even does the hand motions. She loves any type of music and the second she hears it, she starts dancing to it whether it�s a hymn, rock, classical or country. Again, she�s Daddy�s girl because Daddy is very musical and Mommy is not.<br>

<b>Favorite Animal</b> - �Pups� or �Tigatigatiga� or �Bloop-Bloop� or �BopBopBop�. Pups is any of our dogs, puppies, or kittens. Tigatigatiga is the cat because we call it by saying �Kitty Kitty Kitty� and that�s her version of it. Bloop-Bloop is the name of her Beta fish. BopBopBop is how she says bock-bock-bock to our free-range chicken.<br>
<br>
<b>Nicknames</b> - Tilly, Till-a-weed (because of the whole "Daisha pill-a-weed" thing), Weedy, Weeders, Booda (because of her big belly), Oscar the grouch (she�s so grouchy when she�s tired)<br>
<br>
<b>Hobbies</b> - Animal husbandry, kind of. Since everything around here seems to be breeding and multiplying, Talea has developed a liking for baby animals. We can�t keep her out of the kitten box and she walks around all day with a puppy or a kitten in her arms.<br>
<br>
<b>Talents</b> - She gives great juicies, so don�t show any skin to her or she�ll have at it. Acrobatics! Hyrum flips her all over the place and she loves it. When she sits on his shoulders she does a countdown of �1,2,3� and then she lets herself fall backwards. She could flip or spin all day and never tire of it.<br>
<br>
<b>Interests</b> -  Books, music, foraging for �bapes� and blackberries, pointing out dog and chicken poop in the yard for someone to pick up and exclaiming �poop!,� carrying kittens and puppies, and being flipped around like an acrobat.<br>
<br>
<b>Sports</b> - A runaway soccer ball at Ammon�s game knocked her over while she was walking, and that�s pretty much her only encounter with sports as of yet. She does love swimming though.
