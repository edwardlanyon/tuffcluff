<b>Favorite Books</b> - The itsy bitsy spider, although he rips it up when he turns the pages, so it�s hanging together by tape. He loves animal pop-up books, but usually ends up destroying them with excess love (in other words, he rips them off).<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Authors</b> - He really doesn�t care yet.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite School Subject</b> - Art (though it mostly ends up on him), personal relations (constantly wants to be with Mommy), PE (loves to play with balls-especially footballs)<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Computer Games</b> - He�s never seen one before. We don�t play video games, or have a playstation or anything in our house. We don�t even play computer games. It�s just not one of our �things�.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Color</b> - He doesn�t care for one more than another at this point. He is fond of camouflage though.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Toys</b> - Cars, the baby swing, and our kitten. He also takes a hanger and uses it as motorcycle handle bars and makes noises as he steers the hanger around the house.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Music</b> - Twinkle Stars (he sings part of it), Book of Mormon Stories (he does the motions), and he likes to sing or hum. He loves to dance to any music that comes on, especially Michael Jackson songs that I blast in the house.<br>
<br>
<b>Favorite Animal</b> - Kittens<br>
<br>
<b>Nicknames</b> - Little Hy, Hy, Little Dude<br>
<br>
<b>Hobbies</b> - Throwing the pillows off the couch, kissing the animals, pointing out spiders in the house, and dumping his shoes out of the shoe basket.<br>
<br>
<b>Talents</b> - Taking his shoes off, imitating Talea, stuffing his mouth to the point of gagging when he eats, giving kisses and hugs, and saying �Thank You� and �Welcome�.<br>
<br>
<b>Interests</b> -  Playing with Talea and the animals, being held by Mommy, taking a flashlight with Talea into a dark closet to jump on the spotlight, sliding down the stairs on his belly, going on wagon rides, playing with Dallas and Weston, and pointing out cows and horses while we�re driving. Hyatt also has a serious shoe fetish right now. He changes shoes more times in a day than Mr. Rogers.<br>
<br>
<b>Sports</b> - Hyatt loves football. He loves to play with balls, but footballs are a favorite. If he hears or sees football on TV, he stops to say �football!�<br>
