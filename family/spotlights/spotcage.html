<b><u>DID YOU KNOW?</u></b><br>
<br>
<img src='Pictures/cag50.jpg' align=left>Cage loves writing letters to her friends and is a faithful email/snail mail pen pal.<br>
<br>
Cage wants to be a writer when she grows up and is already developing her portfolio with the publication of her first article in her school newspaper. In her spare time Cage is also planning her upcoming book.<br>
<br>
Cage is so good at the piano that she's already learned Beethoven's Fur Elise (the Vince Guaraldi arrangement) and she's only 9!!!<br>
<br>
Cage loves riding motorcross motorcycles so much that she is saving up for one of her own (see <a href="../../news/news/newsfal03.html">"Un-Caged Enthusiasm"</a> in our news archives).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>CAGE SAMPLER</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>Acadamia:</b><br> 
Cage learned to read at the age of four with phonics and Dr. Seuss. She loves to read above all else and has more reading points than anyone else in 
her grade level (138+ compared to 2nd place kid who just broke 100). Cage has been involved with the 100% club since September (all 
homework in on time and correct). She is doing very well academically and is remembered by teachers for her ability to define abstract concepts like "a muse."<br>  
<br>
<b>Talents:</b><br> 
Cage is especially gifted in the arts and can draw, write, sing, act and play the piano. She is looking forward to tryouts for the talent show (she wants to play the piano).
