<img src='Pictures/kirpnt.jpg'align=right> Kira keeps busy in the Cluff girl tradition. She changes clothes frequently, draws, paints, sings, dresses up and plays make believe. She loves babies, cooks, does arts and crafts. She was the winner at her school in the first grade for the Reflections art contest this year with her watercolor portrait of her Dad. She can�t resist animals, isn�t afraid of snakes or bugs and must garden and make bouquets. She also likes fishing, adores the seashore, and cleans, she gets that from her Dad. And, she loves to bring family members special trays filled with good things to eat.<br>

<img src='Pictures/kiram6.jpg' align=left> Kira has also been helping her Mom out with modeling dresses for a children�s clothing designer.  You might be able to see Kira at www.amandaremembered.net.  Kira has been published in a couple of magazines as well.  She has decided that she would  rather be the photographer instead of the model. She gets that from her Mom.  Her goal is to enter a photo this year in the Reflections contest instead of a painting. <br>

Kira has tried the violin and looks forward to piano lessons. To keep her fingers nimble she is learning to type with SpongeBob. She has quite the falsetto voice if you can coax her into singing for you. <br>

This summer Kira has fallen in love with reading. She has read nearly all the �Magic Tree House� series books. She gets that from her big brother. Recently she has identified with Junie B. in, �Junie B. Jones is a Toothless Wonder�. She had two balloon walks last year in 1st grade for the amount of books she read.<br>

This summer Kira broke her foot. Despite the risk of re-breaking it, Kira is an avid bicyclist along with her Dad and brothers.  She is hoping Santa brings her a bigger bike this Christmas.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Kira is beautiful inside and out.
