<b>"BIRDS"</b><br>   
by Soren Beal (kid expert on birds) 8/03<br>
Birds are very interesting, if you think about it. They sometimes land on your flowers, trees, lawn, or telephone wires. Almost everywhere you can see birds. Even in the North Pole. Some birds look very strange, like birds in rainforests, deserts, and other places. Some birds are vegetarians or predators. Birds-of-prey are predators, (or meat eaters.) They scavenge (like vulchers), steal and hunt.  One bird-of-prey is the peregrin falcon. It can dive and go about 260-300mph. Pretty fast, huh? Well, have you ever seen a bird-of-prey? Like in a zoo, or maybe in your back yard, like an owl. Birds-of-prey are illegal to keep as pets. But they�re fun to look at. Maybe you�ve been to a bird show. Birds-of-prey are usually big birds, with exceptions.<br>

<b>"LAKE RIDE"</b><br>
by Soren Beal <br>
This summer we went skiing. We got into the boat and had to go get gas. After that we went onto the lake.  I tubed once.  It was bumpy. Then my dad and Greg double skied.  Then I got to drive the boat, and we saw this HUGE FISH!!!  Maybe three feet long!  We zipped right by it and turned around to get a closer look.  It was dead.  Belly-up dead.  But it was big, real big. We were wondering if we should pick it up, but we decided not to. Then we skied a bit more and docked the boat.<br>

<b>"COMETS: THE FIERY FLYING FURNACES OF SPACE"</b><br>
by Soren Beal<br>
Well, actually, comets are cold, really cold. Comets are objects that orbit the sun. When they are orbiting the sun, and when they get close enough to it, the sun's heat melts the comet so that a tail is formed. It is like a huge snowball. Solar energy heats the comet, which creates gas and dust that forms the comet's tail. Some comets have two tails: a dust tail, and a gas tail. The dust tail is more yellow than the gas tail. The gas tail is bluish in color. Some comets can be seen with the naked eye when they get close enough to the earth. However, most comets can only be seen with large telescopes. We cannot always predict when a comet will appear, but Halley's comet is an exception. This comet appears every 74 to 79 years, and will be seen again in the year 2061.<br>
When I was four years old, my Mom and Dad watched the comet named Hale-Bop as we drove through the mountains of Washington and Oregon. It was during winter, and the skies were crystal clear. I, personally, do not remember seeing the comet. I was asleep in the back seat of the car.<br>
