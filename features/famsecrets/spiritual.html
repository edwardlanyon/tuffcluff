<center><b>Diana On... SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT </b></center><br>
I have had help from the Lord over and over in my life. Last summer I woke up with abnormal head pain and tried to help myself but had no change in the pain. Within 30 minutes I told Dad I felt like I was dying. I had a strong impression to get a blessing before trying to get to the hospital. Dad listened to me even though he was distraught about my condition. After the blessing my head pain was cut in half and in another 15 minutes, it was gone. My body quit shaking and I didn't feel nauseous anymore. This help from the Lord, through a priesthood blessing, allowed me to get to the hospital. Without it I don't think I would have made it because I was in such bad shape. With aneurysms, many people die before or during surgery. The doctor said my operation was touch and go, but everything was okay in the end. This is an example of how the Lord works when we call upon him to help us with a problem that we can't handle on our own. We've had this help many times in our lives with illnesses, accidents, our children and in many other situations.<br>

<center><b>Diana On... MARRIAGE</b></center><br>
Marriage is sooooo much more fun than living single. A married couple can help each other and build a happy family life together (the most fulfilling thing you can do). Children make life so happy and married couples can give children a good example and great start. But marriage is at its highest when its forever (not for the few short years of this life). Only a few know this truth and have had the chance to live it. Most people think they will be together forever when they marry, but there is only one place with the authority on Earth for that to happen--the Temple. It takes time to prepare for that kind of marriage with faith, learning and repentance. Nothing on earth compares with a Temple ceremony. Dad and I were married in the Mesa Temple almost 40 years ago. 40 years seems like only ten, looking back. I love being married. As life goes on marriage is even more valuable to me than ever before. We have loved and adored each other, have raised a fantastic family, have moved to many locations and shared a lot of fun (and some sad) experiences together. Now, as our life moves to its conclusion, the thought of being married forever is one of the greatest joys we experience.

<center><b>Diana On... OBEDIENCE</b></center><br>
Unhappiness and trouble comes from not obeying. I've always told the children that disobeying is not worth it because it makes you feel sick inside. It's best to avoid things that cause you to feel this way, however, we all get a bit side-tracked from time to time and need to ask for help. We can always get help through repentance, regardless of whether we've been obedient or not. I think obedience is the greatest principle for people to follow because it leads to happiness, peace and a sense of direction in all things. I'm not saying that when we obey we won't have problems and sadness to face from time to time (that's what makes us strong) but during the problems we can keep inner peace and happiness until they are all over. The greatest riches in this life are peace, love and family. These can be achieved through obedience. Obedience pays off at its fullest in heaven when we will have all joy, peace, and riches forever. Obedience is the only gift we can give our Father in Heaven as he has everything except our obedience. Jesus was who he was, a great God and our Savior, because he was obedient to the Father. He has set the example and showed us the way to be like him. I am going to follow and obey Jesus because I know that doing so will make me happy here and hereafter.

<center><b>Diana On... TRUTH</b></center><br>
Truth is truth and whether people believe it or not makes no difference, it is still the truth. One of the main things we have come to do on earth is find truth and then live it! (ie: marriage, cleanliness, manners, honesty etc...)

<center><b>Diana On... CHURCH ATTENDANCE</b></center><br>
I was lucky to have wonderful parents that loved me and taught me the gospel. The first experience I can remember with the spirit was when I was in church in Bluewater, New Mexico. I was so young that I was still sitting on an adult's lap as we listened to the talks in the chapel. I felt so warm, like being on the beach on a sunny day. I never have forgotten that feeling and learned later, as I experienced the spirit other times in my life, what the spirit felt like when it testifies truth to me. I always tell young mothers in church, when they are having trouble with their children being reverent, that they are still getting something out of church--even if it doesn't seem like it.

<center><b>Diana On... MISSIONARY WORK</b></center><br>
When we lived in the home my father built in Ashland, a little girl my age, Mary Elizabeth Adams. moved in across the street. I made friends with her sitting in a dry ditch filled with weeds in front of our house by telling her stories. Her parents saw us and ask Mary what we were talking about. She repeated the stories which were about the gospel of Jesus Christ. They asked for the missionaries and took the lessons and were baptized. They became missionaries for the rest of their lives and brought many people into the church.

<center><b>Diana On... PRAYER</b></center><br> 
It's so nice to be able to have direct communication with our Father in Heaven through prayer. I like how Tevia in Fiddler on the Roof always had direct communication with his Heavenly Father, even when he wasn't on his knees.

<br>
<center><b>Diana On... LOSING A CHILD</b></center><br> 
I am a mother of ten. If one of my children died tomorrow I wouldn't suddenly consider myself the mother of nine. If a child breathed, that child was alive. I would always remember and talk about the lost child. I would remember that when I married, my children were sealed to me in the only place on Earth that has the authority to seal couples for eternity. Eternal marriage is the only marriage that gives a child the right to be reunited with his/her family after his death. Eternal marriage and family sealing is the richest blessings we have on Earth because it is a spiritual blessing, as is accepting and living the gospel. Of all the talents we developed in the pre-existence, spiritually was the most difficult, and still is for people on Earth today. I have looked foreword to having Barten with me again. This is a great gospel blessing that I will enjoy if I remain faithful. Now the time is short when that will happen even though, when he died, it seemed it would be so long till I would be with him again.

<center><b>Diana On... LIVING THE GOSPEL</b></center><br>
When people accept and live the gospel, they have rich lives and true joy. Blessings are poured out daily. They'll have eternal marriage and family, priesthood blessings when sickness or trouble comes, the windows of heaven opened to bless when needed, peace and happiness in troubled times, direct communication with our Father in Heaven through prayer and the holy ghost as a constant companion to comfort, teach, warn and testify of all things. They'll also have an easier life (a life of un-repented sin is the hardest life to live) because being led by the prophets keeps them in the ways of the Lord through council which helps with daily life. Knowing the Gospel would mean that each person would know who s/he is, where s/he came from and where s/he is going after this life. This is why I am so glad all my children were able to have the gospel and be baptized in it. If we do not humble ourselves and become obedient to our Father in Heaven, by accepting the gospel, we can not go to our heavenly home, as no unclean thing can dwell with our Heavenly Father in his clean state. That is why repentance, baptism, and the Savior's atonement is required for us to go home to Heaven. I am thrilled that all of you have the chance to have the happiest of all earth lives, if you live the gospel. When we don't live the gospel laws we can repent because the Savior suffered and gave his life to pay for our sins. I have needed repentance many times and will continue to need it till my life here is up. If people really understood what they would get if they would accept the gospel, they would be lining up to accept it so they could be rich, happy, peaceful and successful with blessings being poured out constantly upon them. Many people today strive to be successful and rich by going after things like fame, fancy homes, cars, clothing and toys. These things may bring comfort but if they are not combined with the gospel and basic spiritual things, they cannot bring true happiness. We have to live by faith, by not seeing our Father and Jesus for these short years on Earth, and be obedient to their council through the prophet. We have to suffer the pain of sinning so we can choose obedience and exercise self-control and have joy. All will know of the gospel in the next world as they knew it in Heaven where our Heavenly Father and Mother taught it to us. The thing that is so great for me is to know and live the gospel now and be having the richest life possible. It seems that those who are spiritual and listen to their inner feelings when the spirit testifies of the truth when the missionaries teach, are the ones that accept the gospel. Someday all will find the truth about eternal marriage and families being sealed together. We are so privileged to know and live the truth now while on Earth. I am so thankful to enter the Temple and do work for my salvation, as well as for others of the family that didn't have the chance to be born when the gospel was upon the Earth. The Temple is the House of the Lord on Earth. I really can't believe I have the privilege to go into it. But I did have to repent to enter the house, and still have to keep repenting daily to keep the privilege.

<center><b>Diana On... CHURCH AND STATE</b></center><br> 
This land was founded by our forefathers as a Christian nation that believed in and worshiped God. Our Grandfathers left England, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany because of religion. They wanted the truth, not what was popular or forced upon them. They accepted the true Church of Jesus Christ in Europe when the missionaries knocked on their doors and taught them. They felt a strong feeling inside that it was true. They felt so strong about it, that it gave them the strength to make a new life in America. The Saints were treated as outcast in Europe because they had chosen the true church, so they had to leave their families, friends, home, belongings and country. The people in Europe couldn't accept people that weren't with the main church of the country they lived in. It is humbling when I think of what our fathers went through; leaving a country, the expense, sea sickness, bad food, lice, the hardship of crossing the plains with a whole family, homesickness, trying to build a new home and being hungry all to come to America where they could worship as they felt was right. And then they were persecuted in America for a long time too. The Governor of Illinois has publicly apologized this year for killing the prophet Joseph and Hyrum, his brother, and harming the Saints to the point where they had to cross the frozen Mississippi river in the dead of winter to find a new home. I am so grateful to my fathers for being brave enough to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ. When anyone receives a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, they have a wonderful change come to them, for the better - always. They become a new person, and seek to live all truth just as Jesus did. They become like Jesus and will someday be perfect like him in the next world. When I was 17 years old I found the truth after reading the Book of Mormon. It changed my life for the good, made me know who I am, where I came from, where I am going and how to behave. The gospel is sweet and good - there is no bad in it. I can't understand why people don't see The Church as only truth and good. It shows people how to live in the happiest way there is. There isn't one bad thing in it. Living the gospel has brought me joy, peace and protection in all my days, no matter what I have had to face in my life. I am glad I found it years ago and live to keep it by following the gospel path. I hope I can be an example for others to find the way to happiness too.

<center><b>Diana On... DEALING WITH ILLNESS</b></center><br> 
About three months after having Tiana I became very sick. All the moving and interior decorating while I was pregnant had taken its toll. It felt like a bad flu that kept me in bed for months and months. I lost too much weight and was so weak that I sometimes had to crawl to the bathroom. One day while I was still sick in bed, my 29 years old sister Kathleen came to visit me with her four little ones in her arms and around her legs. She'd had a sore on her breast that hadn�t healed in four years. She had been to four doctors in California and Oregon over the past four years for help. They each said the same thing, �you are having babies and nursing, don't worry about a sore on your breast�. But the last doctor had decided to take a biopsy. The day Kathleen called to tell me she had been told she had melanoma cancer and only 6 months to live, I almost fainted. I prayed that the Lord would strengthen me and I would be able to get out of bed and help my sister. Each day I went over to her home to work on the problem. I took her to an herb store that had just started in the valley and we worked with herbs, which were a new thing at the time. I had been studying while in bed and had learned a lot, as I hadn't gotten help with my sickness and was trying to find a way to heal myself. Kathleen's doctor was impressed at how much improvement the sore was making but the cancer was all through her body already and we hadn't been giving her herbs to drink or putting them on the sore, which would have been the way to go. I played scripture tapes and rubbed her feet which gave her some relief and help for her mind. She died in my arms five months from the time she had found out she had the cancer. The day she died, I knew the moment I woke up she would die that day and called all the family to come say goodbye to her. I was the last to arrive at her home, as I had gone to tell her children their Mother was going to die and wanted to know if they wanted to stay home or go to school that day. They chose school but Lisa cried about it and I had taken time to hug and kiss her. When I arrived at Kathleen's house my Father's family had already come and gone. And as she was dying I told the housekeeper to call her husband, Phil, to come from work. He came just as she died. I felt impressed that I should be the one to care for Kathleen's children after her death so I asked Phil if I could care for their four children, as they would feel the best with our family of children near their ages. We also had a great yard to play in. I ended up looking after nine children; ages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12. The family had a fun time together and I was given strength to be on my feet all day and do the work required to care for them. My legs were tired at night, as I didn't have time to sit - even for meals. After a while I suggested a wonderful friend of Kathleen's, Robin, for Phil to marry. They met and began courting. Finally, about a year after my illness had started, I could feel my health leaving me and soon others had to take Kathleen's children as I was near death myself. One day I told my husband I was going to die and was in a great deal of pain. My brother Monte was at our home getting milk from our milk cow. He and Dennis gave me a blessing. I stopped breathing during the blessing but finally came back. When the men left the room, hoping to get me to the hospital, I knelt down in prayer to ask what to do, as I had already tried a doctor and wasn't getting any help. In my mind I was told to go to Salt Lake City to a Polish doctor on 3rd Street that did acupressure, which at that time was like going to a witch doctor. I was also told to take Pepto-Bismol to help settle my stomach so I could travel. I had never taken it before in my life but it stopped my problems and I was able to fly to Salt Lake.  I was so sick that it hurt if anyone or anything touched me - including my clothes. My family thought I was out of my mind when I told them the answer to my prayer, but they decided to trust me. Monty flew Dennis and I to Salt Lake and the doctor cured  me of my heart problem without an operation.
