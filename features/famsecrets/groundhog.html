</table><br>
I'm not sure how our despicable Groundhog tradition got started, but it has to be one of the most hated and feared rituals in all of Christendom. The mere mention of the "hog" sends ripples of terror through the neighborhood and strikes fear into the very hearts of every decent citizen within a 15-mile radius of the Cluff homestead. And that's the way we like it! As a Cluff descendant you are genetically predisposed toward groundhogging, and it is your duty to perpetuate the tradition of your ancestors. If you are to successfully carry the torch of groundhog greatness you will have to be patient, you will have to endure years of training and you will have to build up an extensive black wardrobe. Follow this step by step guide and you will be well on your way to becoming a master groundhogger. Good luck!<br>
<br>
<b>Step 1--G Day</b><br>
Groundhog's Day is on February 2nd ONLY! Attempt the following on any other day of the year and risk being stripped of your Ghog-status. Your actions are only justified on February 2nd!<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2--Stocking-up on Supplies</b><br>
17:00--Sortie to the back yard. You'll need several large buckets/containers, several small army-regulation beach pails and a shovel. Fill each of the large containers with dirt (under cover of darkness) and load into a van or SUV. Now, head to the mess for your rations. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 3--Pre-Op Chow Down</b><br>
18:00--Dinner should be thematic and consist of a groundhog-like mound of mashed potatoes and even a crudely-fashioned meat carving of the hog (if so desired) to get you into the spirit of things. Be sure to eat heartily because you'll need your strength for the activities that follow. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 4--Kitting Yourself Out</b><br>
19:00--Dress from head to toe in dark (preferably black) clothing including gloves and a ski mask (balaclava). Footgear should allow for a quick getaway--but shoes with reflective strips or light-up features are out! <br>
<br>
<b>Step 5--Transport & Patrolling</b><br>
20:00--When choosing a driver, it's important to eliminate applicants who aren't entirely familiar with their vehicle (how it handles and how far the engine noise carries in the night). Take no chances! Once a suitable driver has been selected troops can file into the vehicle. Drive past your target several times to ensure that no bogies, snipers or ambushers are lying in wait. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 6--Initial Approach</b><br>
21-23:00--Approaching your selected target/house is a delicate procedure that requires skill and precision. At least 100-200 yards out, your driver should switch off his/her lights and kill the engine. Use army-regulation beach pails to scoop dirt from the larger containers in preparation for the swoop. Open well-oiled vehicle door and deploy a scout at this point.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 7--Infantry Unit</b><br>
On the 'all-clear' from the scout, troops should advance in single file (careful to avoid dogs, electric fences and sensor lights) towards the objective. 30 feet from the target troops should fan out and secure the perimeter. Once guards have been posted and the coast has been deemed clear--elite troops bearing loaded army-regulation beach pails should advance to the front door and deposit dirt in neat, groundhog-like mounds on the doorstep. A flag wishing its victims a Happy Groundhog's Day can be stuck in the mound for a nice final touch. At this point, guards and elite troops should head back to the vehicle--but one kamikaze grunt must stay behind to finish the job.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 8--Special Operations</b><br>
The kamikaze's objectives are 1) to alert the target family of their recent delivery and 2) to escape. Ringing the doorbell is risky because a faulty or imperceptible bell could spell death for the operation. A robust knock is preferable. Knock at least four or five times and RUN!!!<br>
<br>
<b>Step 9--Retreat</b><br>
The car should be running and on its way. It's the grunt's responsibility to make a dive for the open side-door--and not miss. Caution: never leave a man behind--he will be tortured if captured!<br>
<br>
<b>Step--10</b><br>
Repeat steps 6-9 at each house.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Troubleshooting Guide:</b><br>
<br>
What to do if you suspect detection: Serpentine!!<br>
<br>
What to do if a man is caught: Deny all knowledge of (or relation to) the prisoner.<br>
<br>
What to say to victims next time you see them: "Groundhog's day? Never heard of it. Is it some kind of Pagan festival?<br>
<br>
Avoiding reciprocation/counter-strikes: 1) post and rotate guards 2) don't have a porch.<br>
