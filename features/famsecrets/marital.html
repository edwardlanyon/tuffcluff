<b>Tricks to Play When You are Mad at Your Husband<br>
By Mother</b><br>
<br>
#1--Food Sabotage<br>
If I was really mad, I would use a hypodermic needle to inject hot Tabasco sauce into his candy bars. I would also put green food coloring in his popcorn. Then we would head for the movies. Dad would eat the candy bar, make a face like he was going to throw up and suddenly jump up and run out. Later when we returned home, he'd find his teeth had turned green. This trick was the most fun when we met people we knew and Dad talked to them with his green teeth.<br>
<br>
#2--Crowd Pleaser<br>
This joke is number ten on my mad scale! Dad was working at a Grocery Store in San Diego and his car was parked out in front. I completely filled the interior with crumpled newspapers, then smeared the steering wheel with honey and turned the window wipers and radio on full blast so that when he turned the key he wouldn't leave unnoticed. I put a big note on the dash of the car saying, 'My Darling Husband, due to the events of yesterday I...' Then I put the rest of the message inside paper where people wouldn't see it. I then hid myself in the parking lot to see what would happen. Dad was late coming out and a crowd of people had begun to gather around his sabotaged car. They were reading the note on the dash aloud to one another and laughing their heads off. Dad came out to see what was going on but, when he realized that it was his car they were laughing at, quickly turned and walked back to the store in a huff. People hung around the car for the longest time and Dad finally had to face them. He came out at a brisk pace, ignored the comments, quickly unlocked his door and started mashing the newspapers down with a angry look on his face. He turned the key to start his car (while still mashing papers down) and was blasted with the loud radio and manic windshield wipers! People everywhere were laughing, and then clapping as he drove off. Dad didn't take that joke too well, but I got my point across and had a great laugh as I watched the events unfold.<br>
<br>
#3--Stealth Laundry<br>
Sometimes when Dad made me mad, I'd purposefully let his laundry sit and sour in the washer. Once I was sure that it had acquired that disgusting soured laundry smell I'd put it through the dryer to lock in the stink. When his laundry came out of the dryer it would smell almost normal--so he'd wear it without a second thought. What he didn't realize was that once it warmed up, the funk would be released. He would be sitting in a stuffy meeting when suddenly a strange smell would begin to rise all around him. At first he'd think it was someone else, but then, to his horror, he'd realize that HE was the funk-meister. Works every time.<br>
<br>  
#4--Bizarre Trick<br>
When Dad was in the Bishopric in Spring Valley and I was the Primary President we both had a meeting with other ward members in the Bishop's office each Sunday Morning. One Sunday I brought a big grocery sack full of his socks, ties and other things all tied up into many knots. I delivered the bag to him saying nothing. Dad opened the bag and pulled out the contents with a big question mark on his face. I told him he knew why I had brought the bag and he had better not make me mad again. Everyone in the room laughed and laughed. To this day when we meet any of the people that were in that meeting, they bring up the bag story and remember Dad's face that day, and how funny it was to see how I dealt with my anger.<br>
<br>
#5--More Fun with Newspapers<br>
After three years of marriage I filled Dad's Den full of crumbled newspapers. He had a struggle to open the door and encountered a very deep layer of newspaper everywhere in the room. I think what had made me mad was that Dad was spending more time in his den reading the newspaper (from the time he came home till bedtime) than with the family. I laughed getting the trick ready but it didn't change anything. Oh well, win some lose some. <br>
<br>
The funny thing was that when I was setting up the tricks to play on Dad, I would get to laughing so hard about how it would probably turn out, that I wouldn't be mad anymore. This also happened to the who called me for advice on tricks, so I guess it could be better than a fight for married couples.<br>
<br>
At this point in our lives, if our marriage is on the down-swing, I am able to just warn Dad not to make me mad and that's enough to gain me an instant "I'm sorry", some flowers, candy, cash, time together alone and a honeymoon trip. That makes us on the up-swing of marriage again and we are able to have an instant solution to our marriage problems.<br>

<b>Halloween Trick or Treat<br>
October 31, 1963</b><br>
<br>
This was one month into our marriage and our first Halloween together. I didn't know that Dad grew up in a family that didn't play jokes on each other. My family had joked constantly. I'd asked Dad at the beginning of October if he believed in fairies, witches, ghosts or elves. He didn't. I told him he needed to believe in these things as Halloween was coming...<br>
We lived near the LA Ram's parking lot by USC. The museums and rose gardens were next door, but the neighborhood was rough and crime-ridden being downtown LA. We lived on the top floor of an apartment with a fold-down bed coming out of the wall into the living room and would run around Hollywood each night for fun after midnight. If you've ever seen Barefoot in the Park, our life was identical to that movie. The movie was even made just about the same time we were married and Robert Redford and Dad are the same age. Anyway, each day at about 7:30am Dad left for USC and then would come home for a quick dinner about 3pm and leave for work at the Supermarket. The area he worked was so rough that the men had to walk out of the store together for safety to get into their cars and go home. Dad arrived home just after midnight each night. I always knew Dad was coming home, as he would whistle in the courtyard of our apartment building when he entered and all the way up to the top floor where we lived. <br>
Halloween night Dad told me to lock the door and not to let anyone in as he was worried about crime in the building especially on this night. When Dad left for work, I started to work on fixing up our apartment for the night ahead. I also cooked a lot of goodies in case he didn't think the surprise I was about to give him was in good taste. Then midnight came and I heard Dad's whistle outside. The whistle continued as he came up to the top floor. When he tried to open the door, there was a loud banging and clanging sound because I'd stacked all our pots and pans up against the door. He quickly shut the door and tried to open it again, but slower this time. More noise. Finally he just threw the door open, as the noise was so bad he just wanted to get in and stop it. He tried to turn on the lights in the dark room but I'd disconnected everything except for an eerie green flickering light from our tiny TV which I'd had set up under a table covered with a sheet. Dad began to feel his way around the room. The room was filled with giant piles of furniture covered with sheets. Everything was blocked off except a path to the bathroom. By this point he was worried that something might have happened to me (he'd been worrying a lot about me all month). He fell into a crouching position and felt his way along the walls toward the TV. He was coming towards me--but facing away from me. I was in the area behind the wall-bed dressed in a filmy white negligee, with my long, dark hair ratted up into a scary Bride-of-Frankenstein style and with warts painted all over my face. When Dad's back was inches from me, I let out a high-pitched scream, pushed the bed down beside him with a big bang, did one of my giant ballet leaps and threw a glass of water in his face! Dad hit the floor screaming. He was in a kneeling position with his hands over his head. I hadn't expected him to be so scared. My family had constantly given each other big scares all the time. Dad just froze in the floor position very shocked and screaming.<br>
I was scared to death now and thinking I'd caused him to have a heart attack--or at the very least, that he'd be really mad at me when he came to. I was so sorry and tried to be nice to him. I quickly kissed him and explained I had warned him about fairies, ghosts, witches and elves. I then told him to get ready for bed and we would eat all my great treats and watch Halloween movies on TV all night. Dad finally got up, got it all straight in his head, then started to laugh and laugh. He had a good sense of humor about the whole thing and I was glad that our marriage had survived our first Halloween.<br>

<b>Dad's Revenge</b><br>
<br>
One year at 7am Dad frantically burst in with the news that there was a crash at the airport--this was just after Uncle Monty had crashed his plane and Aunt Kathleen had died of cancer. Mom was ill and having to tend 9 children (4 of Aunt Kathleen's) all at once. She scurried to the car and drove to the airport to see who crashed (and if it involved a family member) but once they got there Dad revealed that it was all just an April Fool's joke. When asked to comment, Mom had this to say; "Bad Taste!!"<br>
