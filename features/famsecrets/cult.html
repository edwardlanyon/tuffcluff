<b>Shopping Lists</b><!---<img src='../Pictures/list.jpg' align=left>---><br>
How many times have you selected a shopping cart only to find that it has old garbage like receipts and list floating around in the bottom of it? This all 
-too-common phenomenon would frustrate and annoy most people, but not the Lanyons. In fact they purposefully seek out carts with litter in the bottom! Why, you ask? Because they collect shopping lists! This bizarre hobby all started when the Lanyons found an old receipt in their cart on a family grocery  
shopping expedition. At first they just ignored the little scrap of paper, but later, when Edward was loading the groceries into the car he got curious and began to read out the list of purchases from the phantom shopper. The unlikely combination of items tickled the Lanyon's funny bones (they're easily amused) and lo and behold a family hobby was born! What would your shopping list would say about you?<br><br>
Want to know more? Here's an excerpt from their family blog:<br><br>
Our Family Hobby<br>
 <br>
As some of you know, we have a very unusual family hobby. Very unusual, indeed! We collect shopping lists. It's more amusing than it sounds - no, really! It all started when Edward found a stray receipt in the bottom of our trolley* which, instead of just tossing, he read aloud. It was something like; finest fish, red cabbage, garlic and Listerine. Something about that combination just tickled us. Next time we went shopping, Dakota took off around the parking lot without a word. I was getting irritated until I saw the look on his face as he came back - like he'd won the lottery but was trying to keep it under wraps! He approached me, all secretive and dodgy*, then whipped out a couple of shopping lists with a proud grin. It started. We made some quick ground rules; our own lists didn't count, be as stealthy as possible and no dumpster diving (as if!). After that it got competitive - who could find the largest quantity, the funniest, the most embarrassing etc. Pretty soon we had quite a pile. <br>
<br>
It's fun because people don't intend for anyone to see their lists so they write in a very real and unselfconscious sort of way (complete with serial killer handwriting, appalling spelling, abbreviations, nicknames etc.). And we find quite a bit of juicy stuff too, which is always good for a laugh. Spelling problems are quite common. The worst offender was the word "yogurt/yoghurt". Here are some examples from our lists - and I'm not making these up!: yoguorts, yoghourts, yogourt, yogruts, jogurt, joghurts, yougots, yoghuts, yogets, yogarts, yogrit and joughurt. Bad spelling is alright, but it's not as funny as when people get the wrong end of the stick completely. We found both "flat jakes" and "flat jaks" instead of "flap jacks" on one guy's list. And who buys "mush"? I thought that was just a fictional, generic term for the stuff they fed to orphans in the olden days, but it was on two lists! Another fun thing to come across is when someone is begrudgingly shopping for someone else; "Lloyd's gross mushroom" or "beers for Gary, but only if price is good". Then there's always the bizarre stuff that make no sense at all like "smelly bits" or "wind" or "curtaining". Once we found a list that had 21 items, 19 of which were personal hygiene related! What was going on with that poor sap? Sometimes the thing it's written on is as funny as the list itself. Once we found list written on the back of a pack of 20 chocolate doughnuts, and all the items were vegetables, diet products and super healthy things. Guess they were feeling a bit guilty after their little binge!<br>
<br>
There's a practical side to list-collecting too. It's really given me insight into the way Brits live (though we have Italian, French and Scandinavian lists too). I feel like an undercover anthropologist! Most of the time it's easy to tell if it's a man or a woman. The handwriting is the biggest giveaway but there are plenty of other clues (sanitary supplies, nursing pads). You can tell if they're old (liver, oxtail soup, pilchards, prunes). You can spot chocoholics, alcoholics, dieters, cat ladies, cheap-skates etc. Sometimes we'll make a game out of it and invent a profile to fit the shopper. Uptight perfectionist with two kids, a gourmet lifestyle, a headache and a secret addiction to gossip magazines. Slob with a pack of dogs, a problem with flatulence, a pending heart attack (excessive red meat) and a flea infestation. Busy mom with a couple of kids in nappies*, no time to cook and may be pregnant again so buys champagne to celebrate (if she's not) and chocolate cake to console herself (if she is) along with a "P-Test". You get the drift. I've also gotten several good meal ideas from the lists, believe it or not. And sometimes I'll see an item that I'm not familiar with reoccurring over and over again so I try it and love it! That's how I found perfection in a fabric softener! And the way I organize my own shopping list has changed now that I've seen so many examples. My two favs are 1) efficient grouping of stuff together according to where it is in the store (canned food, fruit/veg, dairy, frozen last) or 2) little days-of-the-week meal plan groupings to ensure meals and accompaniments work together. I've made a whole weekly meal plan of my own after being inspired by a few of the lists I've seen (Mexican Mondays, Tandoori Tuesdays, Wildcard Wednesdays etc). Who knew lists could come in so handy?! That said, I dispose of my old lists very carefully now!<br>
<br>
List collecting is harder than you might think because they're actually quite hard to find! But that rarity helps to make it much more exciting when you do finally spot one. We don't get to go hunting as often as we'd like because I do a lot of my shopping online, but maybe that helps to keep it fresh! The only drawback to this super duper family hobby is that you kinda feel like you want to wash your hands after. But mostly, it's just a good laugh. <br>

<b>Postcards</b><br>
Melanie and Daisha collect postcards wherever they travel. It's the one thing that's cheap, easy to find, is associated with a specific place and easy to transport. To make it more fun, they write anything interesting, funny or horrible that happened at that particular place on the back of the card so they'll never forget - like a travel journal. Also, having a postcard means that you always get a great picture of your vacation spot even if the weather, the view or time of day when you visited was not ideal.<br>
