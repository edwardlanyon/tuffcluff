<b>Garlic (Allium Sativum)</b><br>
For preventing illness, boosting your immune system or helping to kill a virus (if you're already sick) take garlic daily. Cut up one clove and swallow with water. Take garlic with food to avoid stomach upset. Don't give children a whole clove, only a little of the chopped clove. Catching your illness early is key. If you feel you are starting to come down with something, take a lot of garlic (about 4 cloves a day) and it should prevent anything from happening. Garlic can also help problem skin and blood clots since garlic is a mild antibiotic and blood thinner. Dr. Andrew Weil says, "Garlic's health benefits have long been recognized in folk-medicine traditions around the world. Even the scientific community can't overlook this aromatic bulb -- research shows that garlic is good for the cardiovascular system. It lowers blood pressure and bad cholesterol (LDL) -- while raising good cholesterol (HDL) -- and inhibits blood clotting, which reduces the risk of heart attacks. In addition, garlic is a strong antiseptic, counteracting the growth of many bacteria and fungi that can cause disease. Eat more of it when you've got a cold, a sore throat, or an ear infection." <br>
<br>
<b>Myrrh (as in Gold, Frankincense and...)</b><br>
Myrrh should be taken in conjunction with garlic at the first onset of symptoms. For adults, take one tablespoon four times per day. Take myrrh, then in two hours take garlic then continue to alternate myrrh and garlic every two hours. Drink a glass of water each hour to flush out the toxins. Take the garlic and myrrh combo for about week, then just a little myrrh three times a day for a few days to kill all the germs. There might not be much change in your health the first day, but by day two you should feel much better. Together, garlic and myrrh should kill the pain of a headache or sore throat. To mix myrrh put three tablespoon myrrh powder in a large empty medicine bottle and add water and shake to make a thin serving. Serve small children one teaspoon 4 times a day. Adults and teens can take a tablespoon 4 times a day.<br>
<br>
<b>Aloe Vera</b><br>
The gel in the thick leaf of the aloe vera plant is great for treating first degree burns, sunburns, mosquito bites, and rashes from poison oak. Just snap off the tip of a leaf from the aloe plant (or cut the leaf open lengthwise) and rub the gel directly from the leaf to the affected area. Using Aloe vera gel on suspect moles also may also help them to get smaller or even go away. According to Dr. Andrew Weil aloe vera also "moisturizes and softens the skin, and because it does a decent job of healing burns, scratches and abrasions, it's often referred to as the first-aid or medicine plant in American folk medicine."  <br>
<br>
<b>Echinacea</b><br>
This herb is safe for daily use and can be used to boost the immune system when a sickness is coming on. Mix the dry herb with water and take it by the spoonful to treat viruses and bacteria. It's very bitter (good for your self-control). Take about four spoonfuls per day or make a tincture and use one dropper full at back of the throat every two hours.<br>
<br>
<b>Golden Seal</b><br>
Good for virus and bacterial infections like colds and flu. Combine echinacea and golden seal together to make golden seal stronger.<br>
<br>
<b>Pumice Stone</b><br>
In addition to smoothing rough feet, pumice can also be rubbed (very lightly) on your face to slough off dead skin and make a smoother, younger looking face. Use different pumice stones for different body parts, obviously!<br>
<br>
<b>Vaseline</b><br>
Vaseline was created in 1859 by a chemist who saw oil workers smearing their skin with an oil residue to help heal burns and scratches. But it can also be used for chapped lips or skin, removing make-up and helping to prevent wrinkles.<br> 
<br>
<b>Water</b><br>
When you are ill it's important to drink at least one glass of water every hour to flush out the body.<br>
<br>
<b>An Alternative to Deodorant!?!?!</b><br>
Milk of Magnesia.<br>
<br>
<b>Balding</b><br>
Don't want to lose your hair? Then eat soy! Dr Bob says tofu is the best. I have been eating it and have noticed my hair is getting thicker now. <br>

<b>Grandma Anna's Secret Tooth Whitener</b><br>
My tooth whitening "secret" is no secret. I do use peroxide approximately once each week or two, but the water I was raised on may have something to do with it. At any rate, I use food grade peroxide purchased in concentrate and diluted to the proportions recommended on the bottle. I keep the concentrate in the refrigerator/freezer and the mixed solution on the shelf. Whenever it seems my teeth are dulling up a bit I take a swallow in my mouth and swish it around for about a minute, then spit out. That's all! You can use plain old brown bottle peroxide if you prefer. No dilution is necessary. It's already a three percent solution and can be used as is.<br>

<b>Plants & Herbs</b><br>
80% of the world uses plants to heal themselves and I am glad I have learned to use them to help prevent and cure illnesses when they come.<br>

<b>Diana's Heart Attack Tips!!</b><br>
When trouble is coming most people have what seems like quiet warnings in their bodies. It is good to pay attention and try to help yourself before the trouble comes. These were the warnings I had a month before I was 60, just before the attack: a feeling of faintness and dizziness and needing to lie down from time to time, extra tired and wanting to sit down more than normal, getting behind in my normal work, a great heaviness in the chest, feeling faint when bending over, difficulty in remembering things that had just been said, falling asleep while sitting up without feeling sleepy, feeling too congested to sleep indoors, blood pressure steadily rising, a tense feeling all the time, extra worried, feeling 90 years old while driving in tight spots or backing up, a slower reaction time and more difficulty in coping with life, family and work than normal. A week before the attack a large lump on the underside of my foot appeared (in the reflexology heart area). Other sore spots on my foot, back and head also appeared. When I had the attack, I felt faint, dizzy, very tense, head pain and a knife pain in the chest to the back. It felt like my blood pressure was up and felt like something major was happening and going to the hospital for help might be necessary. To help myself I bit my left pinky finger very hard for a minute for so. It sounds silly but it really helps to give relief to the heart. I asked my husband for a priesthood blessing. In my mind came the thought to use acupressure on my sore feet with a sock-darner. Sitting up in bed to work on the feet is the easiest way. Then I used my fingers to work on my head and neck in all the sore spots. I rubbed the sore spots or put pressure on them by holding a finger on each sore spot for a minute or so. Dennis rubbed the sore spots on my back for four days each morning an night for over a half-hour each time. After a week most of the soreness on my head was very reduced or gone. I used a heating pad at night for the first two days, to ease the back pain. I took two aspirin to stop the pain on the first day. It worked very well, but I have not had much aspirin in my life so it is extra effective for me. The pain returned in ten hours when the aspirin wore off but the other things I was doing helped to reduce the pain. I stayed in bed to rest for a week and had visitors call instead of visit, as it is too exhausting to sit up to visit. I took black cohosh in a tincture, 5 to 10 drops in water each morning and night, as it reduces blood pressure and is good for the heart. I drank 1/8 cup of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water twice a day to help clean out the veins and warm up the ice cold feet and hands that come from bad circulation with the attack. 500 mg of Niacin is a big time blood circulation booster giving your body a really hot flush. 50 mg of zinc and a chopped clove of garlic each day is good for the heart too. Stop using salt. Using a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in a large glass of warm water is suppose to stop heart attack when it starts. Some people keep a capsule of cayenne pepper (or aspirin) with them always to swallow in case of a heart attack. I didn't take cayenne but maybe salsa would give some help. I took one teaspoon of magnesium powder a day. Eating fruit and juices daily helped clean out my body and made it easier to process food. After 24 hours the feeling of a knife in my back and chest was showing an improvement and in another day the pain was much better. In two more days the pain was mostly gone. Rubbing reduced the sore spots and the large spot on my foot almost disappear in a week. Keeping up all the above plus acupressure and herbs for a week brings returning health. In a week I was able to spell and work on the keyboard in a normal way again. It will take more time to stop the dizziness and weakness from all the trauma but enjoying T.V., movies, reading, small walks, sitting in the sun and relaxing will help the body till the healing process is finished. Each day you should drink extra water and eat a few walnuts or almonds to help during the healing process. Then keep up the daily walking, healthy eating and reduced stress. If you pass out or don't feel you can catch your breath in the heart attack, emergency help is needed - or if itï¿½s not available use the cayenne pepper drink. The main thing I learned this sickness was to roll a roller on my legs, arms, chest and stomach. I had lots of real sore spots and gained energy and felt a world better after rolling them. Massage works faster than taking medicine to make one feel good. I worked on my feet, head and hands while Dad did my back for a couple of months once I'd had the attack and it brought me better health. Body massage really did the trick to make me better.
