<b>My Personal Body Health:</b><br>
Basically I am a wave when it comes to exercise. I go up and down and back again when it comes to exercise routine. For example, at the moment I simply haven't the time to hit the gym (of which I, and you should too, have a membership). But exercise is completely logical. You must be able to exercise logic when it comes to exercise. You must do it, and if you don't then why are you reading this?? Exercise makes me happy, alert, healthy, back-pain-free, limber, strong and looking like a hot mamacita. Even if it's walking, that's it, you will feel better in life. For some reason, those endorphins kick in and you feel better, and better. <br><br><br>

<b>Lose Pounds:</b><br>
Running is the fastest way to lose pounds, but is extremely hard to acclimate to. But if you simply want a total body transformation, I suggest running. Try only 10 minutes at first. Then do walk-sprint-jog-walks. Running will take of weight fast, but it is not great for the joints or the female reproductive system (which may not be of concern to a few out there anymore).<br><br><br> 

<b>Yoga:</b><br> 
I recommend doing Yoga, because it is the #1 best for strengthening the back, as well as alleviating soreness there. I like to do Bryan Kest Power Yoga. <br><br><br>

<b>Weights:</b><br>
I like to work with weights, but beware, you will lose fat and inches but not weight. When I workout with weights I stay the same weight, and I do get a bit bulky, but I look great. <br><br><br>

<b>Workout Videos:</b><br>
I believe in The Firm workout. It is hard, but well worth it, as is Bryan Kest Power Yoga. <br><br><br>

<b>Every Little Bit Helps:</b><br> 
I recommend taking the stairs instead of the elevator (I always do, even if I am lugging heavy stuff), NEVER trying to snag that premier parking spot, walk the extra 50 feet. And play with your kids, dancing especially. <br><br><br>

<b>My Personal Food Health:</b><br>
I like to eat healthy because it leaves me with a more satisfied feeling, and sometimes taste, than when I don't. I find that cheating a bit when you diet is the key; otherwise it's hard to stick with it. And I usually am never on a "diet" I am merely... "eating well" ha-ha. Basically everybody knows what is healthy to eat, I think the problem is that people have health-food phobia, or organic-phobia (especially those who grew up as I did), but healthy food isn't always tasteless or like eating "cardboard" as my dad likes to say. You just need to find a good balance between what you know is right and what tastes good. That way you will be getting the right nutrition yet eating yummy as well. I can give my own recipes out (because they are so darn good) but everyone needs to experiment for themselves as well. And stop eating white bread all the time! And white-floured food! You don't need to do it all the time so why are you?<br><br>

<b>Food Ideas:</b><br>
I love carbs, so to maintain a healthy physique I eat whole grains and low fat, for example...<br>
<li>Brown rice cakes with low fat (not non fat) cottage cheese with basil, pepper or other herbs. Sounds gross, it's not! Ask Tiana. However, this is a snack food, they don't fill you up. <br>
<li>I like to make sandwiches on sprouted wheat bread (Alvarado Street is the brand) with all the trimmings: bell peppers, red onions, romaine lettuce, hummus, olives, mozzarella cheese and salami. <br>
<li>I enjoy making my own hamburgers, sans the bread (substituted by lettuce, as in a "lettuce bun", basically) with plenty of yellow onions and Swiss cheese and fresh ground pepper. <br><br>

<b>Diet Tips:</b><br> 
<li>Buy fresh fruit and veggies DAILY. Eat them each day! Like the French!
<br>
<li>Keep yourself busy during the day and you wonï¿½t get bored to the point of snacking.<br><br>
