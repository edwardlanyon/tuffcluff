<center><b>LANDSCAPING <br> By Tiana</b></center> <hr><br>
<b>BORDERS:</b><br>
<br>
For borders, I choose to do flowing lines instead of boxy lines that follow the shape of the house. If you have curves, it breaks up the monotony of all the lines of the house and creates visual interest in your yard. I just lay out a garden hose or extension cord in the design I want to create. Then I either let it sit there for a few days so the grass smashes down and leaves a line for me to follow when I dig, or I use upside-down spray paint and paint the line following my guide (but you�ll end up getting paint on your hose or cord). I�ve tried using rope and twine, but a hose is my favorite tool. After your line is marked out, grab a shovel and dig out the area you don�t want.

<b>MULCHES FOR LANDSCAPING:</b></b><br>
<br>
<b>Bark: </b><br> 
Bark comes in several sizes. The smaller the size, the worse the slivers you get from walking on it (remember Dallas and Weston�s feet when the driveway was barked?). If you get big nuggets, they don�t sit well on each other, so they get knocked around a lot, and it looks like a tree shed its bark in your yard�not so pretty. I prefer the medium size. It sits well, tries to stay in place, and looks nice. It doesn�t decompose as rapidly as the small stuff. I love the red color bark has, but I hate how it moves around so much. <br> <br>             
Pros- beautiful color, relatively cheap (roughly $1 something per cubic foot), easily found in bulk at landscape supply places (buy it by the yard for the best price).<br><br>
Cons- turns grey rather quickly, you have to replenish it to keep it looking good, depending on the size of bark, it can give you nasty slivers if you walk on it.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Rubber:</b><br>
Pros- looks like bark, keeps its color far longer than bark, helps environment by recycling, stays in place, lasts 10 years or more<br><br>
Cons- may contain steel or nylon bits (so it�s not good for areas where children play), expensive ($13-15 per cubic foot)<br><br>
<br>
<b>Rocks: </b><br> 
There are tons of different kinds of rocks. Please, do the world a favor, and do NOT put lava rock (pumice) in your yard (red or white). It looks like trailer trash, and is awful to walk on. You never see it in the yards of people with taste. Do yourself and everyone who looks at your yard a favor and use a smooth stone. You can get pea gravel (small pebbles), drain rock (medium size), or the larger stone. I like to use a combination of the small and medium in laid out patterns, but you can add the large in too if it�s appropriate. You can make faux dry creek beds with gravel, and it looks pretty neat. Pea gravel scatters easily, but drain rock stays in place well, and it�s easy to kick back into place if someone does throw it around.<br> <br>           
Pros- stays put, acts as a weight for landscape cloth, long lasting, gives good texture and color to your landscape, easily moved if you change your mind, easy to find (buy in bulk)<br><br>
Cons- more expensive than bark, tempting for kids to throw and play in.<br><br>
<br>
<b>Cocoa:</b><br>             
Pros- beautiful, brown color, nice texture, smells like chocolate<br><br>
Cons- toxic to dogs in they ingest it, probably tempting for kids since it smells good, it�s probably spendy, not easy to find<br> <br>
<br>
<b>Pine straw: </b><br>       
Pros-attractive, good texture/color, stays put, natural weed inhibitor<br><br>
Cons-apparently you can only get it in the south. I can�t find it anywhere on the coast and was told it�s only in the south. I�d love to try it! I�ve heard Mel uses it.<br><hr>
<br>
<b>LANDSCAPE CLOTH:</b><br><br>
Whatever you use, you�ll most likely be covering it with landscape mulch (bark, rocks, etc), so in my opinion, the cloth better last a long time because I don�t want to rake up my mulch and redo the cloth all the time, then recover it. I want a long term solution in the first place. Buy garden stakes (get more than you expect to use) to secure the fabric.<br><br>

What I recommend using: Grey landscape cloth that feels and looks like thin, but heavy-duty, stiff-ish felt. It has fibers that are randomly oriented, just like felt, so it�s very hard to tear, but easy to cut. The only weeds that have managed to grow where I�ve put it are at seams where I didn�t overlap enough, or at the perimeter. Any weeds that are growing on it have planted themselves on top via wind or water (they didn�t grow through it), so all it takes is the slightest tug and they come off, no sweat, and no tools. This cloth is very durable, but since its life is longer, its price is higher. I found that Costco has a screaming good price on huge rolls of it, but I only ever see it in Costco in the spring. I�m stocking up next year because it�s way cheaper there than even WalMart.<br><br>

What I use in a pinch: Black landscape cloth is easy to find (WalMart, hardware stores, garden centers, etc) and relatively inexpensive. It cuts and tears easily, so it�s easy to use. It has a plastic texture with miniature holes for drainage. Its downfall is that it isn�t strong enough to hold back tough weeds (you�ll have to spray them with roundup) and it decomposes faster than the grey stuff I love. If people walk on it, it quickly gets holes and rips, which allow weeds through.<br><br>

What I�ve heard: If you take a whole newspaper (not just one page), and soak it in water, then layer it with other wet newspapers, they�re supposedly the best weed block. I like a long term solution for a weed barrier since I cover it with rock or bark, and I�m worried that newspapers will decompose too rapidly or possibly encourage fungal growth and insects, so I�ve avoided trying it. Maybe I�m wrong though. Has anyone tried it? Also, I�d have to raid a newspaper recycle bin since I don�t subscribe to a paper. Is that legal?<br>

<b>NATURAL, FAST GROWING FENCES:</b><br><br>

<b>Bamboo:</b> Fast growing, but very invasive/destructive if it�s the running variety. Try to stick to clumping varieties. If it�s a runner, pot it in huge pots to avoid the nightmare of trying to control it.<br><br>

<b>Leyland Cypress trees:</b> Mine grew something like 4 or 5 feet this season. I planted them last year. They take up room width-wise since they�re a bushy tree, but they grow tall, fast, and thick.<br><br>

<b>Laurel</b> (always green) or <b>Photinia</b> (green leaves with red mature leaves in autumn) are great choices for fast growing hedges. If you top them each year, they will fill out bushy and thick as they soar upward.<br><hr>
