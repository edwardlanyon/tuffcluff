<b>CORN</b> (Plant in Spring, Harvest in late Summer)<br><br>
To plant a crop of corn Dennis Cluff style you will need:<br><br>
Corn seed, soaked overnight in water, then drained<br>
Freshly tilled soil with nitrogen or fertilizer added<br>
A Hoe<br>
An assistant<br>
<br>
Begin by firmly setting the hoe into the soil and pulling up an opening large enough for your assistant to throw two to three seeds in it.  Release the soil and take a step backward, resetting the hoe in a fresh spot, about a foot distant from the first planting.  As your assistant moves forward instruct them to step firmly onto the ground you just planted, setting the seed in well.  Repeat until you reach the end of the desired size of your corn patch.  You should leave room to do a second planting about two weeks after the initial planting.  Corn should be sewn after danger of frost.  It is a �heavy feeder� and needs to be rotated each year.<br>
