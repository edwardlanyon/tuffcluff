<b>The Tuffcluff's are a talented bunch. Here are a few of our undiscovered superstars and what they should be famous for:</b></center><br>
<img src="../../Pictures/cage.jpg" align=left>Cage is only a few years away from being a rockin' bass player superstar! She started playing bass when she was in the 5th grade (2005). "My main objective, begins Cage, "was to get good enough to start a band, and I've been constantly trying to round up my friends to make one - and I think I'm on the right track! I've found a friend who is going to start up playing the drums, and I also have a couple friends who play guitar. Right now, It's mostly just me and my future-drummer. We've thought up the name Belle and Dragon. I play mostly rock, but I've found out that you can play quite a variety of music with the proper muting techniques! Some of my favorite bands to play are the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ACDC, Franz Ferdinand, and Green Day. As for how far I've come, my first song I ever played was the starwars theme song - you know! Dondondon DON..Don dondondon DON don dondondon dOOOOn don don-don-don-Dooooooooooonn! Anyway, now I'm working on an awesome song by the RHCP, as well as "Time" by Pink Floyd. Both are pretty challenging. I love them."
