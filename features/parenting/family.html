<b>Fall Theme:</b> Communicating<br><br>
<b>Encouraging Empathy</b> Laurie Kramer, Dept of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois suggests implementing a routine called "see it my way, see it your way." �Children are taught to stop, take turns listening to each other's thoughts and feelings and repeat the sibling�s words to see if they heard correctly. This helps them listen and consider another's point of view.� <br>
If anyone is having problems with siblings arguing with each other or with parents, this would be helpful. It�s always a good idea to ask if your child is understanding what you are saying. Lots of times they don't understand the wording you are using, or just don't understand some word, and it is so frustrating to them, not to mention you.<br><br> 

<b>Time Together</b>
Our family is so all over the place now. With all the activities and all the kids it's so hard to get together. I truly believe that Family Home Evening keeps us together. It's just a short time, usually 1/2 hr, but it is a time we don't plan anything else. We know we always do it every week. It is a time when we go over the week�s activities and ideas. We have a short lesson that the kids plan, or someone has been assigned. Sometimes we just get it off the internet. And if we forget to prepare a lesson, we go over what we learned in church. This is also a perfect time to just let them all know when they are all together that you love them and appreciate their obedience. Tell them you trust them, you appreciate them, and you want to help them in whatever they need. The kids might roll their eyes, but it gets in there. Play a fun game at the end. This is Jazzy's favorite part! There are fun games you can play as a family. We get a weekly letter from the LDS web and it gives us a FHE lesson and activity and sometimes even a recipe for dessert! It's great! Remember, families that play together, stay together!
