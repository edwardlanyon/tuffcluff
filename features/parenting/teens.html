<b>Fall Theme:</b> Communicating<br>
Why won't my parents listen to me? Ammon's Views...One of the main reasons parents don't listen to their teens is because they always think they know more and they are right about everything and don't really care. Most parents will listen.  Ammon's suggestions are for teens to gain respect by being obedient to rules parents have set. Simple things like getting homework done on time and phone call limits. Things like this show that the teen has respect for the parents rules and wants to do the right thing. Respect is the big one here. If you still feel like they don't listen to you, just sit them down and have a talk with them. Let them know how you feel.<br>
