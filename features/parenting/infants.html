<b>Fall Theme:</b> Communicating<br>
Communicating, already? It's hard to believe that as soon as that precious baby takes his first breath, he begins to communicate with you. He has actually been doing it for quite some time inside you. Every movement, tone, every kiss your baby is getting to know you. You are teaching him with every touch. He learns that when he crys, you are there. He learns when he feels uncomfortable, you are there to help him fix the problem and make things better.  You are teaching him he can rely on you, you are always there for him and always will be. As he grows and begins to make sounds, gurgles and reach, it is most important for you to react with the same sounds or other happy sounds to let him know you hear and will answer. This teaches him he can talk to you always, that he is interesting to you and that he can share with you. Communication is one of the main facets of life. We all must learn it and it starts now.

<b>Help!</b> I have a poor friend whose baby won't stop crying. He is about 4 months and she has tried everything. Her dad is my dr and even he is at his wit's end. They have even tried Benadryl! I guess his cry is so high and shrill they are about out of their minds. He only sleeps for about 1 hr at a time. Any one have any good suggestions for htis poor mother?  She is so sick of people saying they can't help her because of their babies always sleeping all through the night. That makes her want to hit someone! I feel so bad for her as she is a single mother and pretty young. Anyway, would love your help! Thanks!
