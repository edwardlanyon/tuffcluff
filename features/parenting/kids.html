<b>Fall Theme:</b> Communicating<br>
Communicating with my children has always been something I put a lot of effort into. They are just beginning school now and they forget all that has happened during the day. But my thoughts are, if I don't show my interest now, they aren't going to want to talk to me later, and probably think I don't care much if I don't ask. I try not to be invasive, just interested. I remember when Ammz would come home from school, I would ask him what he did and he really could not remember. I learned to ask him what he had for lunch. He tended to remember that, or at least some of it. Then I would ask him who he played with at lunch, he could usually tell me. If he couldn't, I would try to ask him some basic things, like what they are learning about, what their teacher was wearing, if they sang songs.. things like that. But I think it's important to, at this age, really show interest in their activities, asking how they feel about subjects in school and friends. It shows you are thinking about them and interested in their lives. I actually keep doing this their whole school career because I want to know how they are doing. Then give them a big hug, a snack, and make sure they do their homework and chores!
