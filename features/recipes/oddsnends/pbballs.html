<b>Peanut Butter Balls</b><br>
<br>
This sticky treat was a Cluff childhood favorite. Knowing this, Diana used the balls as stealth vehicles to hide/sneak in herbs, medicines and other vile things the family didn't like. <br>
<br>
Peanut butter<br>
Honey<br>
Granola/nuts/raisins<br>
Powdered milk (if too sticky)<br>
<br>
Put a glob of peanut butter into a Tupperware container then add honey, granola, nuts and raisins. Mix well. Eat by the spoonful or make into little bite-sized balls.
