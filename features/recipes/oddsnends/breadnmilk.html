<b>Wild West Bread 'n' Milk</b><br>
<br>
This here ol'-fashioned pioneer/cowboy recipe has been handed down through the generations (which might be why only blood relations can stand it!). It's the easiest, quickest, darn tootin'-ist recipes this side-a the Rio Grande. But if yer gonna try it, ya gotta have true grit 'cause the sog can take a bit a gittin' used ta. Serve 'em up with a side-a cottage cheese and some raw, manly vegetables (green onions & radishes) with salt fer the dippin'. Yeeehaaaa! <br>
<br>
Crusty Bread (the heels from <a href='bread.html'>Mom's homemade bread</a> tastes best)<br> 
Milk<br>
Veggies & salt--optional<br>
<br>
Break up bite-sized chunks of bread and put 'em in a big ol' bowl. Pour 'nuff milk in ta cover it real proper-like and dig in!
