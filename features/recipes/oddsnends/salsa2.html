<b>Secret Ex-Boyfriend Salsa</b><br>
<br>
This mild, mouth-watering recipe comes from one of Daisha's ex-boyfriends. She says it was the best thing about the relationship. It took her nearly a year to coax this secret recipe out of him, and once he gave it to her she promptly broke up with him. Cruel, but it was worth it. You might want to double it.<br>
