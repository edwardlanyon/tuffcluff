<b>Ants on a Log</b><br>
<br>
This was another Cluff childhood favorite. It a good, healthy high-energy snack for imaginative kids.<br>
<br>
Celery stalks<br>
Peanut butter<br>
Raisins<br>
<br>
Spread a generous amount of peanut butter into the concave side of a stalk of celery. Place a row of raisins on top (single file) down the stalk. And there you have 'ants on a log'.
