<b>Chevy's Salsa</b><br>
<br>
This yummy recipe comes from a restaurant cloning web site (see bottom of New Favorites page). It's very nearly addictive. The liquid smoke flavor is the secret--but careful not to overdo it.<br>
<br>
6 medium tomatoes<br>
10 jalapeños (red chipotle is best)<br>
¼ of a medium Spanish onion<br>
2 cloves garlic<br>
2 Tbsp. white vinegar<br>
2 tsp. salt<br>
2 Tbsp. fresh cilantro<br>
1 ½ tsp. mesquite flavored liquid smoke<br>
<br>
Preheat your barbecue grill to high temperature. Remove any stems from the tomatoes, then rub some oil over each tomato. You can leave the stems on the jalapeños. Place the tomatoes on the grill when it's hot. After about 10 minutes, place all of the jalapeños onto the grill. In about 10 minutes you can turn the tomatoes and the peppers. When almost the entire surface of the peppers has charred black you can remove them from the grill. The tomatoes will turn partially black, but when the skin begins to come off they are done. Put the peppers and tomatoes on a plate and let them cool. When the tomatoes and peppers have cooled, remove most of the skin from the tomatoes and place them into a food processor. Pinch the stem end from each of the peppers and place them into the food processor as well. Toss out the liquid that remains on the plate. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor and puree on high speed for 5-10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency. Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or overnight while the flavors develop. Makes approximately 2 cups.
