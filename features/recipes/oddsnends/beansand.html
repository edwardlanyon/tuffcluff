<b>Bean Sandwich</b><br>
<br>
Yes, this really is as disgusting as it sounds! Just try explaining to your friends at the school lunch table what that brown, gooey substance oozing out of your <a href='bread.html'>round bread</a> is. "All of my children shuddered when I tried to serve them," says a bewildered Diana. "But I grew up with bean sandwiches and so did Dad. It's best to serve them only when the children are starving or have been fasting for a long time, otherwise they won't eat them. And who knows, they may try them and find they love them as I still do." <br>
<br>
Beans, see <a href='beans.html'>Moms Bluewater Beans</a><br>
Salad dressing/mayonnaise or butter <br>
<a href='bread.html'>Bread</a><br>
<br>
Add mashed beans and salad dressing/mayonnaise together for the filler between two slices of bread and hey presto!<br>
