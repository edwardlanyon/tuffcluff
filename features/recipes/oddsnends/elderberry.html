<b>Homemade Elderberry Jam</b><br>
<br>
Every November, from the top of Dead Indian Road, we harvest these stinky little purple berries to make some of the tasiest jelly ever. It's hard to believe that something so good can come from something so foul smelling.<br>
<br>
Elderberries<br>
Pectin<br>
Sugar<br>
Twist-top jars and canning lids<br>
<br>
Put elderberries into juicer/steamer and extract juice (stinky stage). Combine juice, sugar and pectin in a pan and follow directions on the pectin packet. Heat jars in 200º oven and lids in a shallow pot of boiling water (with a spoonful of bleach to ensure a good seal). Pour hot juice mixture into a hot jar then quickly put the lid and ring on (not too tight). Turn jar upside down on a towel to cool for a good seal. If the lid is slightly depressed on top when the jam has cooled, it has sealed properly. Repeat with other jars.
