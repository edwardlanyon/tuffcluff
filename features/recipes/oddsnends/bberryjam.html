<b>Mom's Blackberry Jam</b><br>
<br>
This recipe is very easy and very good. The jam tends to end up fairly runny--so it's good for pancakes, French toast, <a href='icecream.html'>homemade ice cream</a> and <a href='blintzes.html'>blintzes</a>.<br>
<br>
Blackberries (raspberries or nectarberries can be used as well)<br>
Sugar<br>
Twist-top jars and canning lids<br>
<br>
Pick and wash blackberries then put them into a saucepan and add sugar to taste. Cook briefly on high heat then turn down to medium until jam thickens and begins to bubble (about 10-15 minutes once it comes to a boil). Don't overcook--it makes the jam sticky and burnt tasting. Heat twist-top jars in 200º oven and lids in a shallow pot of boiling water (with a spoonful of bleach to ensure a good seal). Pour hot jam into a hot jar then quickly put the lid and ring on (not too tight). Turn jar upside down on a towel to cool for a good seal. If the lid is slightly depressed on top when the jam has cooled, it has sealed properly. Repeat with other jars.
