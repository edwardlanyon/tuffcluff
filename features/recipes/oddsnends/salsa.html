<b>Dad's Delicious Chunky Salsa</b><br>
<br>
This fantastic recipe may take a lot time and elbow grease, but ohhhh man is it worth it! Chunky salsa doesn't come any better than this! But be careful, too much and you may develop a chemical dependency on the stuff. Don't forget the tomatillos--they're the secret ingredient.  <br>
<br> 
1 large clove garlic<br>
2-6 jalapeños, seeds removed<br>
4 small tomatillos (about ½ cup)<br>
1 medium white onion finely diced (about ½ cup)<br>
½ green Italian pepper, finely diced<br>
¼ cup pepperoncini<br>
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley<br>
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro<br>
Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons)<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
<br>
In a food processor, finely chop garlic and jalapeños peppers. Add tomatillos and chop again. Remove mixture and combine it with the remaining ingredients. The salsa can be served immediately but the flavour will blend better if it's chilled for several hours or overnight. For salsa with more bite add more jalapeños, some cumin or a dash of vinegar. Makes about 3 ½ cups.
