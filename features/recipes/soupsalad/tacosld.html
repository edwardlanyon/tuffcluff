<b>Gloria Pitzer's Taco Salad</b><br>
<br>
This quick and easy recipe comes to us from Gloria Pitzer, the queen of copycats and rip-offs. She may not be a genuine Cluff, but she's a Cluff at heart. I mean, a packet of taco seasoning--how brilliant is that?! And you can't argue with dinner for 10 in less than 7.5 minutes. For more rip-off recipes go to the 'Top Secret Recipes' link at the bottom of the Cluff Family Favorites home page.
