<b>Melanie's Perfect Pasta Salad</b><br>
<br>
This ohhh-so-scrumptious salad is handy when the vegetable crisper needs cleaning out because the only vegetable it doesn't contain is a rutabaga (but what good recipe does)? There are no set proportions here. Just follow your instincts.<br>
<br>
Pasta, cooked and drained (shells, rotini, macaroni etc)<br> 
Cheese, cut into small cubes (pepper jack is best)<br>
Red & yellow bell peppers, sliced thin<br>
Artichoke hearts, quartered<br>
Kidney beans, drained<br>
Carrots, grated<br>
Broccoli, cut into small bits<br>
Peas (frozen or fresh)<br>
Olives, sliced<br>
Red Cabbage, shredded<br>
Pimentos<br>
Pepperincinis with juice<br>
Italian dressing
Salami strips (optional)<br>
<br>
Combine all ingredients and drizzle with Italian dressing. Chill. Makes a big ol' bowl.
