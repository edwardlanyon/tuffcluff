<b>Dad's Clam Chowder</b><br>
<br>
This clam chowder is excellent and can stand on its own feet--but always tastes a bit better with those little octagonal oyster crackers that we used to eat by the handfuls as kids. Also, clam chowder is always better the second day once the favors have had a chance to mingle overnight. <br>
<br>
<br>
3 &nbsp 6 ½ oz. cans minced clams<br>
<br>
Drain and save the juice, add water to make 3 cups, and chop the clams to small size.<br>
<br>
3 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled (set aside bacon and drippings)<br>
<br>
Into 2 Tbsp. of bacon drippings add the clam juice and:<br>
3 cups of raw diced potatoes<br>
1 large chopped onion<br>
2 tsp. instant chicken bouillon granules<br>
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce<br>
½ tsp. thyme<br>
¼ tsp. coarse ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes--or until the potatoes are tender. Mash the potatoes against the side of the pot with a fork.<br>
<br>
Stir together:<br>
3 cups milk (adjust thickness of chowder by adding or subtracting amount of milk)<br>
2 cups ½ & ½ or light cream<br>
3 Tbsp. flour<br>
<br>
Add to the potato mixture. Cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly. Stir in the Clams, bring to boil again and cook for 1-3 minutes more. Top with the crumbled bacon bits and serve with oyster crackers. <br>
