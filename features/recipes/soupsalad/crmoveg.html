<b>Cream of Vegetable Soup</b><br>
<br>
Dad is a bit of a soup and salad fanatic. His soup is revered and renowned through Cluffdome. But many of his creations are made up on the spot, so it's difficult to get a firm, set-in-stone recipe out of him. Here's what he came up with for Creamy Soups.<br>
<br>
You choose: Cream of Cauliflower, Broccoli, Asparagus, Potato, Mushroom or Squash<br>
<br>
Cook the vegetables (saving best bits to steam and add later)<br>
Add a chopped onion to the vegetables<br>
Add chicken bouillon to the cooking water<br>
<br>
When all is cooked, put the vegetable/onion/broth mix into the blender and blend it for 1 minute till smooth. Now to a stockpot on medium heat add:<br>
1 cube of butter/margarine<br>
<br>
When it melts, add:
Flour to soak up all the liquid (usually 1 T. flour for each T. margarine, so about 8 T. flour).<br>
<br>
Let that brown to remove the raw taste of the roux. Then add:<br>
Milk or cream, all at once<br>
<br>
Adjust the thickness with leftover broth or milk. How much you put in depends on the thickness you prefer. Stir with a whisk often and as it begins to bubble and thicken, you can add more milk until you are satisfied with the thickness. Turn the heat down and let it simmer for a minute or two. Then add the blended vegetables  (and steamed vegetables). Again, let it simmer for a couple of minutes to bring up the temperature to even throughout. <br>
<br>
Add whatever spices take your fancy (basil, oregano, a little thyme, a couple minced cloves of garlic, coarse black pepper, sage, marjoram, etc.)<br>
