<b>Mom's Cowboy-Style Potato Soup</b><br>
<br>
Whether this tasty soup is a true cowboy classic or not is unimportant. The important thing is that it provides a platform for the dying art of theme table decoration. It's all about atmosphere. To set the mood, Mom suggests playing country music and setting the table with candles and cowboy trinkets (an old boot, gun, spurs etc). Wear your cowgirl clothes (I assume this doesn't apply to the men) and hat to dinner too. You can substitute pioneer for cowboy, if you wish.<br>
<br>
8-9 medium potatoes<br>
1 onion<br>
¼ cup chicken bouillon (or to taste)<br>
1 can canned milk<br>
Dash salt, pepper & garlic powder<br>
<br>
Boil potatoes and onion together then add remaining ingredients and puree in blender bit by bit until creamy and smooth. Serve with green salad, grape juice and either scones, rolls, homemade bread or crackers.<br>
