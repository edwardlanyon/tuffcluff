<b>Dad's Broccoli and Cheddar Soup</b><br>
<br>
Dad is the master of soup. This recipe is for Broccoli Cheddar but can be adapted for asparagus or cauliflower as well. He usually makes enough for a couple of meals and then freezes the rest for another day. <br>
<br>
4 crowns of broccoli, cut into small bite size pieces<br>
2 cups cheese, shredded<br>
<br>
Fill a stockpot 1/3 rd with water and start it boiling. Cut the stems from the broccoli, leaving only the florets. Put the stalks into the boiling water and put the florets into a separate pot. Begin to flash boil/steam the florets.<br>
<br> 
To the boiling stockpot add:<br>
4 stalks celery, chopped<br> 
2 medium onions, chopped<br> 
<br>
By now the florets are finished (still firm but softened). When the vegetables in the stockpot are tender, turn off the heat and pour the water into a large bowl, straining out the vegetables. Put 1/3rd of the vegetables into a blender bowl then take a cup of the water from the boiled broccoli and add a tablespoon of instant chicken bullion. Pour into the blender with the veggies and blend for about 1 minute, or until they are creamy. Repeat this for all the veggies. Pour them into another bowl that will hold it all. Then add to the pot:<br>
A cube of margarine<br> 
<br>
Melt it over medium high heat. When it is melted put a cup of flour and blend it with a whisk then let it cook for a minute or until it just begins to brown. Now add:<br>
A couple quarts of milk all at once <br>
<br>
As it thickens add all the blended veggies and let them simmer till it all thickens. If it is not thick enough, take a cup or two of milk and whisk in a tablespoon or two of flour and, when there are no lumps, pour it all into the pot and let it thicken up. Then dump in all the florets that have been sitting aside in a bowl and stir carefully. You don't want to disintegrate the florets. Now when it is all set, turn off the heat and pour in: <br>
Two cups of shredded cheese<br>
<br>
Bring to a simmer, carefully stirring it all together. Now the secret seasonings:<br>  
Garlic powder or minced garlic<br> 
Basil<br>
Oregano <br>
Thyme<br>
Salt<br>
Coarse ground black pepper<br>
Lawry's seasoning<br>
