<b>Mom's Pacific Lime Mold</b><br>
<br>
It's potent, it's oozy and it's glow-in-the-dark green. No, it's not nuclear waste; it's Mom's famous iridescent Sunday side dish--Pacific Lime Mold! This robust Jell-O spin-off is as original as it is intense (it's the salad that bites you back). I'm unaware of the history behind this concoction, but I'm sure the effect of the cottage cheese dangling, mid-suspension, in the green wobbly mass is what inspired the 'mold' bit. As for 'lime', the jury is still out on whether this is in reference to the citrus fruit or the caustic chemical. Assuming it's the former, the salad's sharp 'bite' can only be explained by the horseradish--a brilliant addition that gives this dish its character (don't you dare leave it out!). Pacific Lime Mold goes great with <a href='roast.html'>pot-roast</a> and potatoes. Sunday dinner just wouldn't be the same without the little green dickens.<br>
<br>
1 large pkg. lime Jell-O<br>
2 cups boiling water<br>
1 small container (16 oz.) cottage cheese<br>
¼-½ cup mayonnaise<br>
1 tablespoon horseradish<br>
1 can crushed pineapple<br>
1 cup cold water<br>
<br>
Mix Jell-O and hot water in a large bowl. Combine cottage cheese, mayonnaise and horseradish in small bowl and mix well. Add cottage cheese mixture and pineapple to the Jell-O and finish with cold water. Mix all and put into long pan in fridge to set. <br>
