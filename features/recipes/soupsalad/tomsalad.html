<b>Mom's Tomato Salad</b><br>
<br>
"Here is a fast, pretty, salad that we love," says Diana. "The boys will only eat it with chips as they think of it as salsa. They freak at raw tomatoes. This salad tastes good just after making it as well as the next day. Good with pasta, chicken and meat dishes."<br>

In a serving bowl mix:<br>
2-5 tomatoes, chopped into large chunks<br>
Green bell pepper, chopped<br>
Whole onion, diced<br>
Flat parsley, chopped<br>
Celery, chopped (optional)<br>

Dress salad with:<br>
Olive oil<br>
Apple cider vinegar<br>
Juice from half a lemon<br>
Ground pepper<br>
Salt<br>
<br>
