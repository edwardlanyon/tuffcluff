<b>Snow Day Chili (Both Parental Versions)</b><br>
<br>
Our annual Christmas tree trek just wouldn't be the same without chili. We always started with a traditional <a href='hotchoc.html'> hot chocolate</a> and chili lunch before Dad would lead the way through the deep snow and into the far reaches of the wilderness in pursuit of the perfect tree. For the rest of this story go to the <a href='../famtrad.html'>family traditions page</a>.<br>

<br>
<b>Mom's version:</b><br>
<br>
Pinto Beans<br>
Ground Meat<br>
Tomato Sauce<br>
Chili Seasoning (cumin, cayenne and chili powder)<br>
Salt to taste<br>
<br>
Soak pinto beans overnight in a large bowl of water. Next day, discard the water and add beans to a large pot of fresh water. In a pan, brown meat and add tomato sauce and seasonings. Mix together and reduce to desired thickness. Let set in fridge overnight to allow flavors to mix for the best taste. Heat and serve.<br>

<br>
<b>Dad's version:</b><br>
<br>
In a large pan cook:<br>
1 lb. ground beef<br>
1 or 2 chopped onions<br>
2 or 3 cloves of garlic<br>
<br>
Until the meat is brown and the onion is tender. <br>
<br>
Then add:<br>
1 can of diced tomatoes<br>
1 can of kidney beans<br>
1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce<br>
2 or 3 teaspoons of chili powder (or use a packet of chili mix)<br>
½ t. basil<br>
<br>
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let it simmer for 20 minutes or so.<br>
