<b>Split Pea and Lentil Soup</b><br>
<br>
The portions and ingredients in this recipe are not set in stone--they're up for experimentation. All Dad's soup recipes can be divided or multiplied easily.<br> 
<br>
In a large stockpot add: <br>
Water<br>
1/4 cup of chicken bouillon <br>
Equal amounts of split peas and lentils (usually 1 or 2 cups of each)<br>
Ham hocks or chopped pieces of ham, to taste<br>
Herbs and spices (bay leaves, basil, sage, marjoram, minced garlic and Lawry's seasoning).<br>
<br>
Bring to a boil then turn heat down to low, cover and let simmer for an hour or two. When the peas are tender, take out the bay leaves and ham hocks. Add desired vegetables while the meat is cooling down a bit.  <br>
<br>
2 chopped onions<br>
2 or 3 ribs of chopped celery<br>
3 or 4 carrots, sliced 1/8th inch thick<br>
2 ribs of chopped bok choy, chopped (optional)<br>
<br>
Chop meat into bite-sized pieces then put back into the pot (without the bones). Let this simmer on med/low heat till all is tender, but not overdone. Carrots are good indicators or readiness.
