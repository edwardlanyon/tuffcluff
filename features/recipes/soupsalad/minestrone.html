<b>Melanie's Marvellous Minestrone</b><br>
<br>
I wanted to call this recipe Melanie's Marvellous, Magical, Multi-coloured, Mystical, Mouth-watering, Multifarious, Miraculous, Means of Mending Malnutrition Minestrone--because that's what it is! But the powers that be forced me to truncate it. Lousy bureaucrats. There are no set proportions for this recipe. Just follow your instincts.<br>
<br>
Brown ground beef/turkey and onions together, drain<br>
Add or delete as applicable:<br>
Stewed tomatoes<br>
Green beans<br>
Kidney beans<br>
Garbonzo beans<br>
Celery<br>
Red cabbage<br>
Green Pepper<br>
Corn<br>
Squash<br>
Carrots<br>
And anything else that sounds good<br>
Then add to taste:<br>
Beef soup base<br>
Garlic<br>
Oregano<br>
Basil<br>
Pepper/Salt<br>
Then throw in pasta (macaroni or whatever you have)<br>
Makes a big ol' pot<br>
