<b>Aunt Judy's Rice, Fruit and Marshmallow Salad</b><br>
<br>
This recipe may sound as though it's made from the stuff at the bottom of your garbage disposal--but it's FANTASTIC! I can't tell you how many of our childhood visits to the George's were motivated by the prospect of this yummy treat! Poor Aunt Judy got so sick of us begging for it, she finally gave us the recipe.<br>
<br>
8 cups water<br>
3 cups rice<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
2 teaspoons oil<br>
1 large container of cool whip <br>
1 bag colored marshmallows<br>
1 large can drained fruit cocktail<br>
<br>
Bring water, rice, salt and oil to boil then turn down to simmer for 20 minutes. When the rice is done allow it to cool before adding cool whip, marshmallows and fruit. Blend together thoroughly and keep in fridge.<br>
