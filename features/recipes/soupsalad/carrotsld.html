<b>Carrot Raisin Salad</b><br>
<br>
Heaven knows where this little concoction came from--Mormon hell, most likely. Yet, it's strangely alluring and even post-modern in its way.<br>
<br>
8 raw carrots, grated<br>
1 cup seedless raisins<br>
1 cup coarsely chopped peanuts or pecans<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
4 tsp. grated lemon peel<br>
2 Tbsp. lemon juice<br>
<br>
Mix these all together. Put it in a bowl and cover with:<br> 
2 cups either sour cream or mayonnaise<br>
<br>
Toss, refrigerate and serve. Cut recipe in half if you like (highly recommended, since most have difficulty finishing their first serving!)<br>
