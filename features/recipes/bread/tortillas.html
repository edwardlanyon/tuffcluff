<b>Aunt Blanche's Flour Tortillas</b><br>
<br>
Aunt Blanche brought this original Native American recipe back with her from New Mexico. Instead of a rolling pin, the Indians would pat the tortillas out on their upper legs. We love the tortillas but suggest you dropped the leg action--unless you run out of grease. <br>
<br>
6 cups flour<br>
2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
2 teaspoons salt<br>
½ cup shortening<br>
<br>
Add warm water to make a stiff dough. Divide dough into 18 pieces and roll out. Fry in a medium-hot pan (no oil) or bake in a fryng pan. Makes about 18.
