This is another yummy Gloria Pitz-Cluff recipe. It's not quite as good as <a href='bisngrav.html'>Dad's biscuit recipe</a>, but it's quicker. The choice is yours. 

<br>
<br>
2 cups flour<br>
2 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br>  
½ teaspoon baking soda<br>
Dash salt<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
½ cup butter, margarine or shortening<br>
¾ cup buttermilk<br>
1 tablespoon melted butter<br>
Extra flour<br>
<br>
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut butter in with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk. Mix quickly to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead a few times to make a soft dough but don't over-knead or biscuits will be hard and dry. Roll out to a 6x6 inch sqare. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. With knife cut dough into 12 even portions. Don't separate. Bake at 400° until golden--about 15 minutes. Dust with flour when they come out (optional). Makes 12 biscuits.<br>
