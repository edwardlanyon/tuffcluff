<b>Tiana's Zucchini Loaf</b><br>
<br>
This comes from a cookbook called “MORMON COOKING Authentic Recipes”. It is an amazing recipe. Everyone adores it. I make it in my Kitchenaid mixer, and I double the batch to get 4 loaves at once. To double it in a standard mixer like mine (versus the heavy duty version), it comes close to overflowing, so you’ve got to be really careful and mix it on a low speed. The following recipe is just for 2 loaves.<br>
<br>

1 cup sugar<br>
1 cup brown sugar<br>
3 eggs<br>
1 cup salad oil<br>
3 teaspoons vanilla<br>
2 cups grated zucchini (if large, removed seeds) <br>
1 cup raisins (optional…I never add them)<br>
½ cup nuts (optional…I never add them)<br>
<br>
Sift together:<br>
3 cups flour<br>
1 teaspoon soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
3 teaspoons cinnamon<br>
½ teaspoon baking powder<br>
<br>
Combine wet and dry ingredients. Mix well. Put into greased and floured pans. Bake 1 hour at 325°. Makes 2 loaves.<br>
<br> 
My additional tips:<br>
Put wax paper or parchment paper (cut to fit) on the bottom of the greased pans to prevent the bottoms of the loaves from sticking to the pan and ripping off when you turn them over. 
Combine the wet ingredients in the mixer first. In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Add the dry mix to the mixer on low speed. I forgot to sift it once, and the end result was just fine. The only difference was that while mixing the wet and dry ingredients, lumps of flour were spinning around and I had to break them up with a fork.
