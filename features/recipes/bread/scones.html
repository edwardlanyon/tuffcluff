<b>Mom's Old Fashioned Scones</b><br>
<br>
This recipe is basically the same as Mom's Homemade Bread--but instead of baking the dough, you fry it. But watch out, this recipe makes a massive batch (intended for Cluff-sized families only). You might want to 1/32nd or even 1/64th it! <br>
<br>
In a small bowl let rise:<br>
½ cup warm water<br>
3 tablespoons yeast<br>
<br>
In a large bowl mix:<br>
12 cups very warm water<br>
1 10 lb, bag of white & wheat blend flour (a cup or two at a time)<br>
1 cup oil (or ½ butter ½ oil)<br>
1 cup sugar or honey<br>
4 tablespoons salt<br>
1 cup bran<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 375°. Combine yeast and flour mixtures and knead by hand, adding flour gradually until dough isn't sticky. At this point it's traditional to let the kids pick at and eat the raw mixture from your doughy fingers--but if you've seen the yeasty-stomach-explosion scene from The Emigrant's Saga, you'll want to skip this step. Let dough rise in large bowl covered by a damp cloth in a warm place. Punch down the risen dough and make scones by frying flattened-out fist sized pieces of dough in hot oil (either in a cast iron pan or in a deep fat fryer). Makes enough to feed a large army.
