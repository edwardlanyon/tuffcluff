<b>Mel's Whole Wheat Pita:</b><br>
<br>
1 ¼ cups warm water<br>
Pinch of sugar<br>
2 Tbs. olive oil<br>
1 ½ cups whole-wheat flour<br>
1 ½ cups bread flour (I use whole-wheat)<br>
1 ½ tsp. salt<br>
2 tsp. yeast<br>
<br>
Divide dough in half, covering one half with plastic.  Divide first half into 5 balls.  Let rest 10 min. under cover while you do the same to second half. Roll out into 6 inch circles.  Cover and let rise 25 minutes.  Place a baking stone in oven and heat to 450°.  Put 5 pitas on one cookie sheet and put sheet directly on stone to bake for 12ish minutes.  Do not open the oven during the first 4 minutes as the steam pushes the two halves of the bread apart.  Do not over bake. Keep baked pitas between two kitchen towels to cool and stay soft. I freeze mine when cool. <br>

<b>Mel's Bread Machine Recipe:</b><br>
<br>
1 1/3 cups 80° water<br>
8 tsp. olive oil<br>
4 tsp. sugar<br>
1 ¼ tsp. salt<br>
2 cups bread flour (I used all whole-wheat flour)<br>
1 1/3 cups whole wheat flour<br>
2 ½ tsp. active dry yeast<br>
<br>
Place on a lightly floured surface.  Divide into 10 pieces.  Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Place 5 calls on a large baking sheet.  Place the remaining five balls on another baking sheet.  Let rise about 20 minutes.  With fingertips flatten each ball into a 6 inch circle. Bake at 500° for five minutes or until puffed and tops begin to brown. Cut each in half to form 2 pockets. Yield 20 pita pockets<br><br>
