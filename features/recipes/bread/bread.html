<b>Mom's Homemade Bread (& Scones)</b><br>
<br>
Comfort food doesn't get any comfier than this--provided you bake it in a cylindrical tin. But watch out, this recipe makes a massive batch (intended for Cluff-sized families only). You might want to 1/32nd or even 1/64th it! <br>
<br>
In a small bowl let rise:<br>
½ cup warm water<br>
3 tablespoons yeast<br>
<br>
In a large bowl mix:<br>
12 cups very warm water<br>
1 cup oil (or ½ butter ½ oil)<br>
1 cup sugar or honey<br>
4 tablespoons salt<br>
1 cup bran<br>
1 10 lb. sack of flour (add flour a few cups at a time)<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 375°. Combine yeast and flour mixtures and knead by hand, adding flour gradually until dough isn't sticky. At this point it's traditional to let the kids pick at and eat the raw mixture from your doughy fingers--but if you've seen the yeasty-stomach-explosion scene from The Emigrant's Saga, you'll want to skip this step. Let dough rise in large bowl covered by a damp cloth in a warm place. Punch the risen dough down and make scones (oil in hot pan and fry) or fill bread tins and let the dough rise again. Bake for 45-50 minutes. Makes about 12 big loaves.<br> <br>
