<b>Melanie's Hamburger Buns</b><br>
 <br>
Soren's favorite. These rolls are really good. Super easy bread machine recipe.<br>
 <br>
1 ¼ cups water <br>
1 egg <br>
6 Tbsp. butter cut into pieces <br>
3 Tbsp. sugar <br>
4 cups bread flour <br>
1/3 cup dry milk <br>
3 Tbsp. potato flakes <br>
2 Tbsp. gluten <br>
2 tsp. salt <br>
2 tsp. yeast <br>
 <br>
Place all ingredients in bread machine pan. Start dough cycle.   
When done, divide dough into 12 portions and shape into hamburger or  
hot dog buns. Place on greased cookie sheet, flatten disk, cover  
with plastic and let rise about 30 min. Bake at 375° for 15-22 min.   
Remove from pan, let cool and slice in half. You may brush an egg  
wash on top before baking, and sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds.   
Great for sloppy joes and summer tomato sandwiches
