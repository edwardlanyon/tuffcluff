<b>Melanie's 12 Hour Dinner Rolls</b><br>
<br>
Melanie gets more requests for this recipe than any other. It's very good and easy but it does require some planing ahead. Melanie usually makes the dough (in her mixer) in the morning, rolls them out at lunchtime and they are ready to eat for dinner. They take very little work, just lots of rising time. They're worth the wait! <br>
<br>
Dissolve:<br> 
1 tablespoon yeast<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
In 2 tablespoons warm water<br>
<br>
½ cup butter<br>
1 cup milk<br>
½ cup sugar<br>
3 eggs, beaten<br>
¾ teaspoon salt<br>
4-5 cups flour<br>
<br>
Put butter in scalded milk. Cool to warm. Add eggs to yeast mixture. Then sugar, salt and milk w/butter. Mix thoroughly. Add flour and stir. Dough will be a little sticky. Cover with plastic and let rise 5-6 hours. Divide in 2. Roll out in a circle as thin as a piecrust. Cut into sixteen pieces, like a pie. Roll from large end. Place on greased pan. Let rise 2-4 hours. Bake at 375º for about 5-7 minutes. Makes 32.
