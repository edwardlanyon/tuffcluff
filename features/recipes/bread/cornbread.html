<b>Dad's Sweet Southwestern Cornbread</b><br>
<br>
All this time I thought Dad had some fantastic, old-fashioned recipe for the perfect succulent cornbread--but it turns out he uses the sweet cake recipe from the back of the cornmeal box. But he's not a total fraud--he does make a few subtle changes to make this cornbread his own (indicated by a * in the recipe). For instance, *He puts the cornbread mixture into a long, deep pan, instead of the recommended cookie sheet!!<br>
<br>
1½ cups flour<br>
2/3 cup sugar<br>
½ cup corn meal<br>
* He usually makes it with 1 C. flour, 1 C. corn meal and 1 C. sugar)<br>
1 Tbsp. baking powder<br>
½ tsp. salt<br>
1¼ cups milk<br>
2 or 3 large eggs<br>
*He separates the yolks and whites and beats the whites to stiff in a separate bowl)<br>
½ cup cooking oil<br>
<br>
Preheat the oven to 350º<br>
Combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Combine the milk, egg yolk and oil and mix well in another bowl. Grease a large baking pan. Mix the ingredients all together *with as few strokes as possible, including the stiff whites. Pour into the pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.<br>
