<b>Dad's Oatmeal Surprise!</b><br>
<br>  
This recipe is nearly the same as Dad's original Oatmeal recipe. The only difference is that it's made during one of Dad's mad experimental phases, and thus contains at least one new and hidden ingredient--probably giblets. At least once a week Dad experiences an uncontrollable desire to be experimental in his cooking. His experimental food is bold and dangerous. His forays into uncharted culinary territory usually always end in either tears or the permanent loss of taste buds. Few dare to try his creations, but those who do seldom live to tell the tale. <br>

Etc...<br>
