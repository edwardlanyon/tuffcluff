<b>Milktoast</b><br>
<br>
I don't know who invented this, or why, but it's worked its way into our breakfast repertoire and is enjoyed by a Cluff or two.<br>
<br>
Milk<br>
Toast<br>
Sugar<br>
Cinnamon<br>
Nutmeg<br>
<br>
Heat milk in a saucepan to hot--but not boiling. Put toast in a large breakfast bowl and sprinkle with sugar and spices. Pour milk over seasoned toast and enjoy--or not, depending on how you feel about soggy bread.
