<b>Daisha's Difficult and Dangerous Egg McCluffins</b><br>
<br>
The ancient art form that is the McCluffin requires patience, a delicate touch and finely tune technical skills. It may take several years to master, so don't beat yourself up if you can't manage it all at once. May I suggest at least one hour of yoga, pilates or Tibetan Monk meditation before attempting the McCluffin--to ensure that you are focused and limber! Do not attempt McCluffins if you have a bad back or are pregnant or nursing. <br> 
<br>
The secret ingredients: <br>
Bread of some description (bagel, english muffin, biscuit, crumpet or even just plain bread)<br>
Butter or Margarine<br>
Eggs<br>
Cheese (your fav)<br>
Salt & Pepper<br>
Non-stick spray<br>
Optional: Meat (sausage, bacon, ham, etc)<br>
<br>
The method:<br>
Coat a microwave safe bowl with non-stick spray and crack an egg into it. Scramble well. Place the bowl in the 'wave and cook for 1-2 minutes (depending on the wattage). Meanwhile, toast and butter two pieces of bread. When the egg is done, put it on one piece of bread and cover it with thin slices of cheese. Add meat here, if so desired. Finish off with salt, pepper and the other piece of bread. Pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds or so if the cheese stubbornly refuses to melt. Enjoy.
