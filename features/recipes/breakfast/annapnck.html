<b>Grandma Anna's Whole Wheat Pancakes with Sunflower Seeds</b><br>
<br>
This is a fantastic recipe that will take you back to Spring Break at Grandma's house in Orange County. For the full effect, serve with pure maple syrup and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  <br>
<br>
2 cups whole wheat flour<br>
¼ cup raw wheat germ<br>
3 teaspoons baking powder<br>
2 ½ teaspoons baking soda<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
3 eggs<br>
3 ½ cups buttermilk (+/- to desired consistency)<br>
2 cups raw sunflower seeds<br>
 <br>
In large bowl mix first five dry ingredients, make a well and beat the eggs in the well.  Add buttermilk, stir until the dry and wet ingredients are mixed.  Add sunflower seeds and stir. (This mixture can be stirred as much as needed, with whole wheat stirring is not detrimental to the batter). Cook in cast-iron skillet or griddle coated generously with olive oil for approximately 2 1/2 min or until bubbles form on top, turn and cook for about 1 min. Serve with pure maple syrup, other fruit syrups, butter or sour cream.
