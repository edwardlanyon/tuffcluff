<b>Mom's Controversial Granola</b><br>
<br>
Controversy has always plagued this granola recipe. We even hesitated to include it in the "family favorites" section because recent taste tests have proved that only two out of twenty Cluffs will eat it. In one camp we have the 'pros' (or non-blood related Cluffs, who both still find the need to be polite) and in the other, more sizeable, camp we have the 'cons'. We have included the following testimonials from both camps, thereby enabling you to draw your own conclusions: <br><br>

<i><b>"I send my granola to 
<a href='Pictures/scott.jpg'>Scott Beal</a> for his birthday--on his request."</b></i> Diana 2003<br><br>
<i><b>"Incredibly potent!"</b></i> US Bio-Weapons Division 2003<br><br>
<i><b>"I just adore it, as I was brought up on it in New Mexico, but it causes big time weight gain (and possible pink eye) when used daily."</b></i> Diana 2003<br><br>
<i><b>"It sets real hard."</b></i> Talent Paving Co.<br><br>
<i><b>"<a href='Pictures/danesfam1.jpg'>Dane & Karen's children</a> would walk clear over from their house to mine to eat it in the morning. They'd always say, 'Grandma can we have some of your Granola?' They wanted it after school too. I was always so glad since Dennis and my children at home didn't like it all."</b></i> Diana 2003<br><br>
<i><b>"It looks like the stuff from the bottom of my budgie's cage--and it broke my <a href='../../leisurecenter/Pictures/daktooth.jpg'>
tooth</a>!" </b></i> Dakota Cluff 2003<br><br>
<i><b>"Mommy, it burns, it burns!"</b></i>

Though much criticized, most would agree that Mom's granola is low in fat, high in roughage and very, very dry. The proportions in this particular recipe could feed a small African country for six months, but Mom suggests putting left-over granola in plastic containers to store in your freezer or motorhome (it travels well) for years of nutritious, inedible family cereal. <br><br>
35 cups rolled oats <br>
4 cups bran<br>
2 cups Donnie Osmond chest hair (Jimmy Osmond is not an acceptable substitute) <br>  
1 or 2 cups brown sugar <br>
4 cups powered milk<br>  
3 cups ground popcorn kernels* (save unpopped, but browned, kernels and grind into powder) <br>
1 small batch Eastern European cars, finely minced<br>
9 cups wheat flakes<br>
7 cups barley flakes (or any other grain flakes) <br>
<br>
Put dry ingredients in a large pan and bake in oven at 200° for a few hours--or overnight for a crisp toasted flavor. <br><br>
Then add: <br>
4 cups raisins (white or golden are best) <br>
3 cups sunflower seeds<br>
Eye of newt and toe of frog  <br>
1 or 2 cups protein powder <br>
And any other nuts, dried fruit (apple, banana, pineapple), powders (a little dry yeast) or shredded reading material that you like. <br>
Mix all and serve with milk or water (use water for trips because the granola has powered milk in it).

*One of the first dry cereals used in America by the Indians was Pinole which
is ground, browned white flint corn. Mom uses popcorn because she can't find white flint corn and says it doesn't taste any different.
