<b>Scrambled Eggs (Both Parental Versions)</b><br>
<br>
You might think scrambled eggs are too basic for a formal recipe, but not if you grew up in the Cluff household. You had a definite favorite one way or the other--Mom's or Dad's.<br>
<br>
<b>Mom's "Best" Scrambled Eggs</b><br>
<br>
12 eggs<br>
3 tablespoons mayonnaise (the secret)<br>
¼ cup milk<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
<br>
Mix all with a fork. Put a little oil in a cast iron pan over medium heat and scramble. Serve with English muffins/toast, bacon and juice. Table decoration suggestions include eggs in a basket, a bowl of fruit or glass farm animals; rooster or mother pig with nursing babies. (As always, table decor not endorsed by the majority of Cluffs). <br>

<br>
<b>Dad's "Best" Scrambled Eggs (Tame Version)</b><br>
<br>
1 or 2 more eggs than the number that will be eaten<br>
A smidgen of mayonnaise<br>
A clump of horseradish<br>
A shot of milk<br>
A dash of coarse pepper<br>
A couple shakes of the salt shaker<br>
<br>
Whip it all together while the bacon grease or olive oil is warming up in the pan. Dump it all in the pan. Medium high heat until it begins to curd up, and then switch it to medium-low heat. Keep pushing it around with a spatula until it forms large curds. When most of the wet is gone, turn the heat off, cover and let it sit for a minute to finish firming up.  Don't wait too long or you get that "frying pan crust" on your eggs. Goes great with toast and orange juice.<br>

<b>Dad's "Best" Scrambled Eggs (Tame Version #2)</b><br>
<br>
Sautee an onion and a couple cloves of chopped garlic in a pan large enough to cook the whole thing. Crack open about 2 eggs for each serving into a bowl. Add a tablespoon of mayonaise and 1 tablespoon of horseradish and 1/4 cup of milk to the eggs. Beat it all up well together (be sure to keep stirring the onion garlic mixture till the onion is transluscent but not brown). When the onion is ready (you should have had the heat on to 2 or 3 [medium low]) Pour the eggs stuff into the pan and make sure the heat is not too high. You want to cook the egg slowly so it dosn't get a brown crust on the bottom. When it starts to solidify, turn it with a spatula so that the uncooked egg spreads over the bottom of the pan. Now shred a cup of cheddar (or whatever you like) cheese and keep it ready. Begin to toast some bread. After most of the egg has solidified but there is still some shiny parts, spread it out over the pan and sprinkle the cheese over it and turn the fire off and cover the pan for a minute or two while the cheese melts. By now the egg should be thoroughly cooked and have a covering of melted cheese. Serve on pieces of toast. Bacon or Ham may be served also if you like and OJ is a good.

<b>Dad's Scrambled Egg Surprise!! (NOT Recommended)</b><br>
<br>
At least once a week Dad experiences an uncontrollable desire to be experimental in his cooking. His experimental food is bold and dangerous. His forays into uncharted culinary territory usually always end in either tears or the permanent loss of taste buds. Few dare to try his creations, but those who do seldom live to tell the tale. Are you tough enough?<br> 
<br>
'Lottery' eggs from chicken coup (never mind the salmonella, it's the fertilized ones you need to worry about)<br>
Giblets <br>
Horseradish, enough to knock you off your feet with one whiff<br>
Anything in the fridge that looks like it might go off if you don't use it within two seconds.<br>
Mushrooms from the backyard<br>
1 Packet taco seasoning--hot<br>
<br>
Mix together in large industrial-strength pan (using bio-hazard gloves and a welder's mask). If egg contains half-formed embryo, set aside for future use in another of Dad's experimental cooking creations. Serve. <br>
<br>
Tip: The wise diner will pre-coat the inside of their mouth with candle wax before tasting one of Dad's experimental recipes. <br>
