<b>Mom's Homemade Yogurt</b><br>
<br>
Those who have visited the Cluff household while this yogurt is 'incubating' in its gallon jar will be relieved to discover this recipe--not just because it's delicious, but because it explodes two age-old myths; the Michael-Jackson-white-skin-growth-farm-in-a-jar-experiment and the gooey-gunge-alien-in-a-jar-preservation-project. Making yogurt might not be pretty, but it's a real thriller, and it tastes out of this world! <br>
<br>
1 gallon milk<br>
1 small pot plain yogurt<br>
Sugar (to taste)<br>
Fruit or crushed berries (optional) <br>
<br>
Put milk in large pot on stove and heat on high till it almost boils. Let cool to med warm, then add the pot of yogurt (culture). Pour mixture into a gallon jar. Wrap the jar with a towel and set it on a heating pad, on low. Let sit overnight. Add sugar (to taste) and crushed berries or your choice of flavors. Can be made in a quart jar for a smaller batch.<br>
<br>
<b>Variations:</b><br>
*Yogurt Milkshake<br>
Put yogurt, a little orange juice concentrate and two bananas/strawberries in a blender then top off with milk and blend. Omit the milk and add ice for a thicker smootie-style drink. <br>
*Yogurt Smoothie<br>
Crush blackberries (or any fruit) with a little sugar and blend with  yogurt and ice cubes for thickness. Milk can be added if desired. <br>
*Sour Cream Substitute<br>
Use yogurt straight from jar without adding sugar.
