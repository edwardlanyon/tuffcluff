<b>Dad's Omelettes</b><br>
<br>
Only two Cluff family members can truly claim to enjoy mornings. One of them also likes yoga and cold showers, and the other one is Dad. Dad's infuriating early morning effervescence is usually best expressed in the kitchen. All the noise he makes (from clattering pots and pans to the high pitched whirr of the blender) is generally forgiven by the first bite. 
<br>
<br>
Get your eggs out and let them get as close to room temperature as possible (this lets the secret Cluff family ingredient, salmonella, blossom).<br>
<br> 
In separate small bowls, get your "fillings" ready:<br>
Grated cheese<br>
Chopped onion<br>
Mushrooms (canned or sautéed)<br>
Chopped ham<br>
Bacon bits<br>
Chopped olives<br>
Crumbled sausage<br>
Green pepper<br>
Chopped tomato<br>
Etc. Etc.<br>
<br>
In a non-stick omelette pan, heat bacon grease or butter on medium/low heat. In a small bowl crack and beat 2-3 eggs. Pour into pan and tilt to enable full egg/pan-coverage. Then A) Add the "fillings" when the egg is nearly done. Fold the egg in ½ and let it sit for another minute or so, or B) Flip or turn the egg (over sink to avoid accidents) to cook both sides before adding "fillings".<br>
<br>
While the first omelette is cooking, you will have cracked and beat more eggs into the bowl so that when the first omelette is done, the next can be started right away. Serve with bacon or sausage, toast and OJ.
