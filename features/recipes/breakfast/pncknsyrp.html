<b>Dad's Saturday Morning Pancakes & Syrup</b><br>
<br>
Go to the supermarket "scratch" section and stock up because these pancakes are made from scratch--and they're the best. You can cut this recipe in half, but why would you?<br>
<br>
Pancakes<br>
Mix together:<br>
2 cups flour<br>
2 Tbsp. sugar<br>
2 tsp. baking powder<br>
¼ tsp. salt<br>
<br>
Then in two separate bowls, separate yolks and whites of:<br>
3 eggs<br>
<br>
In bowl with yolks add:<br>
2 cups milk <br>
4 Tbsp. cooking oil<br>
<br>
With a hand mixer, beat the whites to stiff but not dry and then beat in milk, yolk and oil mixture till blended (Don't mix the yolk, milk mixture first or the egg whites will not stiffen up). Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients all at once and stir with minimal strokes. Add the egg whites an, again, stir as little as possible. There will be some lumps, but they will take care of themselves. When a drop of water sizzles on the griddle, it's ready. Pour in ¼ cup batter for each pancake. <br>

<br>
Homemade Syrup<br>
1 cup white sugar<br>
1 cup brown sugar<br>
1 cup water<br>
1 tsp mapelene (or vanilla) extract <br>
<br>
Mix sugars and water together and bring to boil then quickly down to simmer, stirring often. When thickened to desired consistency, take off heat and add mapelene. Makes about 2 1/2 cups.<br>
