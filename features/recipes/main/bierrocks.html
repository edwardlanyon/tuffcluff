<b>Melanie's Yummy Bierrocks</b><br>
 <br>
Bierrocks are basically hot German rolls filled with meat, cheese, cabbage and onions. Delicious!<br>
 <br>
Use frozen dough or...<br>
Basic roll dough:<br>
1 package yeast<br>
¼ cup warm water<br>
1 egg <br>
1 cup milk<br>
¼ cup sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>  
¼ cup butter/margarine<br>
3 ½ cups flour<br>
<br>
Soften yeast in water. Combine eggs, milk, sugar, salt and butter. Cool to lukewarm. Add 1 ½ cups flour. Add yeast mix. Add remaining flour. Let rise 1 ½--2 hours.<br>
<br>
Filling:<br>
½ lb ground beef/turkey<br>
1 cup onions<br>
3 cups chopped cabbage (or sauerkraut)<br>
1 cup cheddar cheese<br>
1 teaspoon pepper<br>
Dash salt <br>
(Add more vegies, if you like)<br>
<br>
Brown meat, add onions and cabbage, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Add salt and pepper then fold in cheese. Allow to cool. When dough is done rising, roll ¼ inch thick and cut into squares. Put filling in each square and pinch shut so they are round like a bun. Set on a greased pan (pinched side down) and let rise for 20 minutes. Bake 20 minutes at 375°. Serves 4-6. <br>
