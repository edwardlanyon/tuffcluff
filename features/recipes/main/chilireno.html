<b>Chili Relleño</b><br>
<br>
l large chili, seedless<br>
½ cup milk<br>
4 eggs<br>
2 tablespoons wheat or white flour<br>
½ cup shredded jack cheese<br>
½ cup mozzarella cheese<br>
8 oz tomato sauce<br>
<br>
Lay large chili in pan. Combine eggs, milk and everything except cheese in pan. Top with cheeses and bake at 350º for 30 minutes<br>
<br>
Serve with <a href='tortillas.html'>Aunt Blanche's flour tortillas</a> (plain or buttered) or filled them with cheese, beans, meat,  sour cream, salsa, shredded lettuce and cut tomatoes.  Or take the easy way and serve Spanish rice and refried beans or just chips and salsa.  Lime juice or lemonade (or a combo of the two) goes well as a beverage. <br>

!!The following advice is not endorsed or recommended by the vast majority of the Cluff-Clan--especially the part about the winking!!<br>
<b>Mom's theme tips:</b> Put on Mexican skirt and pheasant blouse and a red rose for your hair worn down with large loop earrings and big bracelets. Play Mexican music and decorate the table with a large hat, a cactus and gourd maracas. Play the Mexican music when you cook to get the family in the mood for fun family Mexican food. Speak Spanish. Smile and wink at the family as you cook and serve the food, as that is a green light to all. An exhausted, griping mother is a red light to all.
