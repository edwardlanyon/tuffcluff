<b>Mexican Chicken Casserole</b><br>
<br>
This little goodie was always made en mass and whipped out from the bottom of the freezer when mom didn't feel like exerting herself for Sunday dinner. Once we found a nail in it! True story. <br>
<br>
1 large onion, chopped <br>
1 Tbsp. vegetable oil <br>
3 medium tomatoes, chopped <br>
2 C. chopped cooked chicken<br> 
½ cup broth <br>
2 tsp. chili powder <br>
1 tsp. salt <br>
1 tsp. dried oregano <br>
1 tsp. ground cumin <br>
6 corn tortillas, cut into fourths and divided<br> 
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese <br>
<br>
Cooked chopped onion, in oil over medium heat, stirring constantly until tender; add tomato and next 6 ingredients. Bring chicken mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer five minutes. Layer half of each of chicken mixture, tortillas, and cheese in a lightly greased 11x7 inch baking dish. Repeat procedure with remaining chicken mixture. Cover with foil and bake at 350º for 25 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with remaining cheese and bake for 5 additional minutes.

Dad's Variation:<br>
Dad's Mexican Casserole is essentially the same as the <a href='cknench.html'>Chicken Enchilada recipe</a> with this change: tomatoes rather than diced green chilis. This mixture is spread over one side of whole tortillas, (rather than cut up tortillas on the bottom of the pan) and rolled and placed with seam side down and mushroom soup (still condensed) poured over them and baked.
