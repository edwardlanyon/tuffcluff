<b>Chicken Enchiladas</b><br>
<br>
3 or 4 skinless chicken breasts, cooked and chopped (set aside)<br>
<br>
Sauté in butter or margarine:<br>
1 large chopped onion<br>
2 Tbsp. diced green chili peppers<br>
<br>
In a medium mixing bowl combine:<br>
1 3 oz. package of cream cheese, softened, (I like to add some shredded cheese too.)<br>
1 Tbsp. milk<br>
¼ tsp. cumin<br>
<br>
Combine onion mixture and chicken. Spoon about 3 Tbsp. portions of the mixture into:<br>
12 medium-large tortillas<br>
<br>
Roll up filled tortillas and place them, seam side down, in a greased 3 quart baking dish.<br>
In a bowl combine:<br>
1  10 ¾  oz. can of condensed mushroom soup<br>
1  8 oz. sour cream<br>
1 cup of milk<br>
1 tsp. salt <br>
1 tsp. oregano <br>
And remaining diced chilies<br>
<br>
Pour this soup mixture evenly over the enchiladas in the baking dish. Cover with foil and bake in a 350º oven for about 35 minutes or until heated through.  Remove the foil and sprinkle enchiladas with shredded Jack or Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven and bake about 5 more minutes or until the cheese melts.<br>
