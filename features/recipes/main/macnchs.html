<b>Homemade Macaroni and Cheese</b><br>
<br>
Dad's the master of macaroni and cheese. This recipe never fails to please. It goes well with a tossed green salad and lemonade. <br>
<br>
Preheat to 350º<br>
<br>
In a large stockpot add: <br>
½ gallon water<br>
2 cups macaroni <br>
<br>
In a large pan add: <br>
4 Tbsp olive oil<br>
Onion, chopped <br>
Meat (sausage or ham are best)<br>
<br>
When onion is translucent (not brown) add:<br>
¼ cup flour <br>
<br>
Stir until all oil is absorbed. Let it brown slightly, this is the roux, then add:<br>
About 2 cups milk<br>
<br> 
To avoid lumps, stir vigorously until the flour and liquid are smoothly mixed. When it has thickened, turn off the burner and add:<br>
1-2 cups grated cheese<br>
<br>
Let the cheese melt then add flavoring: (garlic powder, salt, coarse black pepper, bullion, Lawrys seasoning etc.). Drain macaroni then pour it into a large baking pan and cover with cheese sauce mixture. Stir until evenly distributed. Bake for 30 minutes. The last 5 minutes, sprinkle about a cup of shredded cheese over the top.<br>
