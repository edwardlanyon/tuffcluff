<b>Chicken Tikka Masala</b><br>
<br>
Chiken Tikka Masala is one of the tastiest Indian dishes ever. It was actually created in the England during the 70's and is now the most popular dish in the whole UK. This recipe comes from a web site, and is still untried. It is, however, an award winner--so hopefully it's good. This recipe is made in two stages. Firstly the chicken must be marinated and cooked; then a sauce must be prepared for it to be served in.<br>
<br>
Marinade:<br>
1 lb large diced boneless chicken breast<br>
1 oz garlic<br>
1 oz ginger<br>
4 tbs fresh natural yoghurt<br>
2 small fresh green chillies<br>
1 tbs lemon juice<br>
1 tsp zeera (cumin) powder<br>
1 tsp dhanya (coriander) powder<br>
1 tsp salt<br>
1 tbs red paprika<br>
4-5 leaves fresh green coriander<br>
<br>
Method:<br>
1) Grind fresh green chillies, fresh coriander, garlic and ginger with 2-3 tbs of water, until a thick paste is formed.<br>
2) Marinate chicken in the paste, then add the salt and the yoghurt to the mixture.<br>
3) Next add the lemon juice, zeera powder, dhanya powder and red paprika, and mix the chicken and other ingredients thoroughly.<br>
4) Leave the chicken to marinate in the paste overnight.<br>
<br>
Sauce:<br>
4 oz chopped onions<br>
3 oz ghee<br>
1 oz garlic (ground)<br>
1 oz ginger (ground)<br>
2 medium tomatoes (liquidised)<br>
3 oz yoghurt<br>
½ tsp salt<br>
½ tsp chilli powder<br>
½ tsp zeera powder<br>
½ tsp dhanya powder<br>
2 tbs desiccated coconut <br>
4 oz fresh single cream<br>
pinch dried methi (fenugreek leaves)<br>
<br>
Method:<br>
1) Take previously marinated chicken and cook on skewers in tandoor. If this is not possible, leave chicken for 10-12 minutes under a grill on a moderate 
high heat.<br>
Meanwhile the sauce can be prepared:<br>
2) Fry the onions in the ghee until lightly brown.<br>
3) Add tomatoes and yoghurt to the onions and mix on a low/moderate heat.<br>

4) Next, add the zeera powder, chilli powder, dhanya powder, salt, desiccated coconut, dried methi and fresh single cream to the mixture and mix thoroughly.<br>
5) Water may be added if a more liquidy sauce is desired.<br>
6) Add cooked pieces of chicken to the sauce and mix in well.<br>
7) Leave to simmer on a low heat.<br>
8) To finish, transfer the completed CTM to a serving dish and garnish by pouring a small quantity of single cream over the dish and then sprinkle liberally with fresh coriander and garam masala.<br>
