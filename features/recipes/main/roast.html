<b>Mom's Sunday Pot-Roast</b><br>
<br>
Sunday lunch at the Cluff house was always either a succulent roast with vegetables, or a nasty frozen mulch casserole made from left-overs and kitchen scraps. The children decided, indirectly, which one it would be. If we gave Mom grief in the morning by lazing around and not getting ready for church--it was the casserole. But if we all pitched in and combed our own hair--the roast became a real possibility. Needless to say, most Sundays we ate casserole. But when, on the rare occasion, we bought enough time for Mom to prepare a roast, it was fantastic. Mom always prepared the roast in the morning and let it slow-cook while we attended church. Then by the time we got home, and out of our Sunday best, it was ready. There's nothing quite like coming home to the smell of a Sunday roast. <br>
<br>
Meat (beef or pork, or chicken)<br>
BBQ sauce<br>
Potatoes, quartered<br>
Carrots, whole or cut in half length-wise<br>
Onions, quartered<br>
<br>
Put meat into a Dutch oven/cast iron pan with a lid. Pour BBQ sauce on the meat and arrange potatoes, carrots and onions around the side. Cook at 250º for at least 4 hours (use less time for chicken, or 200º). The slow-cooking/cast iron method makes the meat very tender and tasty.
