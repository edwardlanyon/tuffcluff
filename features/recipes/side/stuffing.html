<b>Thanksgiving Stuffing (Both Parental Versions)</b><br>
<br>
Each year Mom and Dad rotate making the Thanksgiving stuffing. The difference being that on Dad's years, the children either run away screaming or cry inconsolably into their plates. Why? Because of the addition of giblets! Try both recipes and see which one you like best. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Mom's version:</b><br>
<br>
Mom says, "You'll make the children sick again Dennis. I'd better handle the stuffing this year."<br>
<br>
4 boxes Rice-a-Roni<br>
4 Kellogs croutons<br>
1 can water chestnuts<br>
Celery<br>
Mushrooms, sliced<br>
Apple<br>
1 lb. walnuts (optional)<br>
<br>
Prepare Rice-a-Roni. Set aside. Brown water chestnuts. Mix all of the ingredients together, stuff turkey or bake in a dish and serve hot. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Dad's version:</b><br>
<br>
Dad says, "Stuffing without giblets is sissy stuff." This actually is a fantastic recipe, as long as Dad doesn't get too carried away with the giblets! <br>
<br>
4 boxes Rice-a-Roni<br>
2 bags stuffing croutons<br>
2 cans sliced water chestnuts<br>
2 stalks celery, finely chopped<br>
2 cans mushrooms<br>
1 can black olives, chopped<br>
Chicken broth<br>
Anything else you'd like (oysters, giblets, anchovies, giblets, bamboo shoots, nuts, spices, watercress, giblets, and you might even try a few giblets)<br>
<br>
Put the croutons in a separate bowl for each bag. Cook the Rice-a-Roni as per directions on the box. Dump half of each of the other ingredients in each bowl and mix with little chicken broth. Too much will make it soggy. Remember that the juices of the turkey etc will soften it up even more. Then salt the inside of the turkey and stuff. Bake turkey with a foil tent over it. Remove the tent for the last  half-hour.  <br>
