<b>Fertility-Enhancing Holiday Yams</b><br>
<br>
This recipe is a Thanksgiving and Christmas staple--albeit a dangerous one (they are infamous for messing around with the reproductive system). Mom claims that it was after eating a whole pan of these yams that her fertility increased (if that's possible) to the point of becoming pregnant with the twins--age 47. But this seems unlikely, given the fact that these yams are only made during the holidays which, by most calculations, would mean that a significant number of Cluff children would have been born in August or September. But none of the 10 Cluff children were born anywhere near these months (the twins were born in January). So the real question here is why was Mom eating a whole pan of yams by herself? My guess is because no one else would touch them. <br> 
<br>
4 yams/sweet potatoes cooked, peeled and mashed<br>
1 cup chopped dates<br>
1 ½ cup brown sugar<br>
1 ½ tablespoon corn starch<br>
¼ teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon mapeline<br>
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon<br>
1 tablespoon orange peel<br>
2 cups apricots halves<br>
1 cup apricot juice<br>
Cook slowly on stove till thickens. Stir. Once thickened add:<br>
2 tablespoons butter<br>
1/2 cup raisins<br>
1/2 cup chopped pecans<br>
Pour all into a long, greased glass pan and bake at 350º till it bubbles.

I ate a whole pan of these yams over a few weeks and within a couple of
weeks after eating I found myself pregnant with twins.  I found out later
that yams are suppose to work like a fertility pill.  I pass this tip to all
that want twins and want to get pregnant.  This tip has helped more than me
have twins.
