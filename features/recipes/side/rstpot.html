<b>Edward's Sunday Roast Potatoes</b><br>
<img src=pictures/eddiepots.jpg align=left>This simple recipe comes from the Lanyons in England. Roast potatoes are part of the traditional English Sunday dinner, along with roast chicken, bread sauce and two veg. They're delicious (despite what you've heard about English food). Give them a try.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters (allow 2 per person)<br>
Salt<br>
Oil (or goose fat, if you want to be traditional) <br>
Gravy granules (No known US substitute--will keep looking)<br>
Seasonings, to taste<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350º <br>
Par boil potatoes (Maris Piper or King Edward are best) with salt for about 7-10 minutes. While boiling, prepare the baking pan with a generous amount of oil and a sprinkling of gravy granules. Heat the pan in the oven for a couple of minutes. Drain potatoes then put them back in the pot over a very low heat and shake them around for 1-2 minutes until the potatoes are completely dry and the edges are slightly fluffy. Then put potatoes into the hot baking pan over the range, turning them until each is well-coated in the warm oil mixture. Season. Put the pan into the oven and bake until crisp and golden brown (turning half-way through), about 30-45 minutes.
