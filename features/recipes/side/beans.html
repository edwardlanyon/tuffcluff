<b>Moms Bluewater Beans</b><br>
<br>
Because Mom's meals generally rely on atmosphere, rather than taste, you'll need to serve these beans with western music, clothing and decor in order for them to turn out okay. Serve the beans with hot <a href='scones.html'>scones</a> for a real old fashioned cowboy meal.<br>
<br>
Pinto beans (soak overnight if possible)<br>
Onion<br>
Salt<br>
Tomato sauce<br>
Optional:<br>
Garlic<br>
Sage<br>
<br>
Cook pinto beans with onion and salt to taste (you'll need lots of salt).
If you wish, put cooked tomatoes or tomato sauce in the beans, then season with garlic
and sage.

TIP: In order to get her children to eat these beans, Mom used to sing this song: EAT YOUR BEANS RIDE YOUR HORSE! EAT YOUR BEANS AND RIDE YOUR HORSE! YOUR A COWBOY, A COWBOY, EAT YOUR BEANS AND RIDE YOUR HORSE. (This tip is for historical purposes only and is NOT, under any circumstances, recommended!)
