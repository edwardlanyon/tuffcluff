Most Cluff recipes are an acquired taste. Do not attempt unless you are familiar with the ways of the Cluff. Diana's recipes generally rely on atmosphere, rather than taste. She tends toward easy, quick or burnt meals with complicated themes (costumes, mood-lighting and themed music) to disguise the lack of effort. Dennis's tendencies are toward the bizarre. At least once a week he experiences an uncontrollable desire to experiment with the family meals. His experimental cooking is bold and dangerous. But his forays into uncharted culinary territory always end in either tears or the permanent loss of someone's taste buds. Few dare to try his creations, but those who do seldom live to tell the tale. All Cluff cooking tends either to be based around a dare or the items in the fridge most likely to rot, sour, mold or go rancid first. But the cardinal rule for eating at the Cluff house is do not, I repeat, DO NOT eat anything containing eggs! They have a rooster in the chicken coop and the eggs are a serious gamble.<br>
