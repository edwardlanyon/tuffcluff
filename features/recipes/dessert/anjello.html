<b>Melanie's Angel Jello Food Cake</b><br>
<br>
Each year we all beg for Melanie to make this yummy holiday treat. Jello and angel food cake may sound like an odd combination, but the taste is simply heavenly.<br> 
<br>
1 large box strawberry-bannana Jello<br>
1 bag frozen strawberries<br>
1 large cool whip<br>
1 angel food cake<br>
<br>
Mix Jello with 1 ½ cups hot water and let stand 15-20 minutes. Hollow out trenches in the inside walls of an angel food cake. Add pieces of cake and strawberries to Jello and fill the trenches in the cake with the mixture. If there is extra mixture fill the center too. Frost with cool whip and refrigerate for 2 hours. <br>
