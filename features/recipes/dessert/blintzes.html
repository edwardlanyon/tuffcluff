<b>Heavenly Blintzes</b><br>
<br>
This recipe goes great with <a href='icecream.html'>homemade ice cream</a> and Mom's <a href='bberryjam.html'>blackberry jam</a>. <br>
<br>
Sift: <br>
1 ½ cups of flour<br>
<br>
Re-sift with:<br> 
1 tsp. salt<br>
2 tsp. baking powder<br>
4 Tbsp. powdered sugar<br>
<br>
Beat: <br>
4 eggs<br>
<br>
Add and beat in:<br>
1 1/3 cups milk<br>
2/3 cup water<br>
1 tsp. vanilla<br>
<br>
Combine dry and liquid ingredients and stir with minimal strokes. Heat a skillet then add a few drops of oil, coating pan thoroughly. Add batter then tip pan to ensure blintz covers the whole bottom of pan. Adjust the amount of batter to desired size. Cook over moderate heat.<br>
<br>
For sweet/dessert blintzes, cook both sides till golden brown then add ice cream, fruit, syrup etc., fold over and serve quickly.<br>
<br>
For savory blintzes (cheese, meat or vegetables) brown only on one side then turn it out onto a paper towel, cooked side up. Add your filling, fold and lay blintzes side by side in skillet (to which you have added ½ Tbsp. oil and ½ Tbsp. butter) seam side down, and fry till golden brown, turning once.
