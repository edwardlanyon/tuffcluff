<b>Old-Fashioned Homemade Ice Cream</b><br>
<br>
This ice cream recipe is expensive, complicated, laborious and absolutely fantastic! There's nothin' like the real thing, baby. If it's tradition you're after, either pistachio or vanilla with blackberry are the all-time Cluff family favorites. Apparently, the old-fashioned way to eat this is with soda crackers, however, this not recommended to anyone who does not hold a valid senior citizen discount card. If you're up for experimenting, go ahead, but remember if you're going to add fruit it should be compatible with the base flavor (pudding mix) or you'll be sorry.<br>
<br>
3 small pkgs instant pudding mix (vanilla, pistachio, etc)<br>
4 eggs<br>
1 ½ cups sugar<br>
2 cups heavy cream<br>
5 cups of milk<br>
Rock salt<br>
2 large bags crushed ice<br>
Optional: 3 cups fruit (crushed with a little sugar)<br> 
<br>
Take dasher out of freezer can, put top back on then install motor on top to hold everything in place. Fill freezer 1/3 of the way with ice then add about ½ cup of rock salt. Repeat with two more layers of ice and salt until full. Let the central reservoir cool while you prepare the mix.<br>
Put milk and cream into a large, pour-able bowl. Add pudding, sugar and well-beaten eggs (not stiff). Make sure the sugar and pudding are dissolved. Open the freezer, pour the mix in, put the dasher back in, close it up and top off with ice and salt as it begins to turn.<br>
If using fruit: After about 10 minutes of turning (it should be thickening) turn the system off, open lid and add crushed and sugared fruit to mixture. Stir well so that fruit goes all the way through to the bottom. Close it up and turn it back on. Let it continue to mix until it stops turning.<br>
Take the dasher out and give it to the least-naughty kid around to lick. Put the lid back on and pack with ice again and let it sit (for as long as you can stand it, probably 20 or 30 minutes) while it sets up. Eliminate this step if you like soft-serve ice cream. Enjoy.
