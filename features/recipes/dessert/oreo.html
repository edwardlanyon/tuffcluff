<b>Lissy's Homemade Oreo Cookies</b><br>
<br>
This divine recipe comes from Daisha's friend Lissy Sanders. These cookies don't actually taste like oreos--they're much nicer. And they don't really feel like oreos either--they're much softer. They're usually quite a bit bigger than a regular oreo too. In fact, the only thing they have in common with an oreo is that they are dark brown on the outside and white on the inside. Try them and see which "oreo" you like best. <br>
<br>
2 devil's food cake mixes<br>
4 eggs<br>
1/3 cup oil<br>
2/3 cup water<br>
Flour <br> 
1 can white frosting (cream cheese frosting is best)<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350º <br>
Mix the first four ingredients together until fairly smooth. You'll probably need to add flour to get a very thick, gooey, cookie dough consistency. Put crisco or butter on your hands to prevent sticking as you roll the dough into balls (any size). Bake 10-15 minutes on an ungreased cookie sheet or until they're puffed up and cracked on top, then remove. After cookies have cooled for a couple of minutes, spread the frosting on half and then put another cookie on top to look like an oreo.<br>
