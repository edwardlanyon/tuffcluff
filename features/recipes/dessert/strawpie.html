<b>Melanie's Strawberry Satin Pie</b><br>
<br>
This delicious recipe is much loved--but we only get it when Melanie is around because, frankly, most of us aren't prepared to make pudding and glaze from scratch. Thank heavens we have an epicure in the family.<br>
<br>
Combine in double boiler:<br>
1 ½ cups sugar<br>
½ cup + 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br>
½ cup + 1 tablespoon flour <br>
1 ½ teaspoons salt<br>
2 packages Knox gelatine<br>
Gradually stir in:<br>
6 cups milk<br>
Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick and smooth. Stir a little of this hot mixture into:<br>
3 beaten eggs<br>
Add pudding mixture in pan and cook 1 minute as you stir. Cool, chill thoroughly (overnight is best). When chilled, beat until smooth then fold in:<br> 
6 oz. cool whip<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla<br>
Pour into 2 baked and cooled pie crusts (graham cracker or Oreo cookie is good) and arrange:<br>
3 cups of fresh strawberries<br>
on top then smother with cooled glaze:<br>
1 ½ cups strawberries<br>
1 ½ cups water<br>
Cook 2-3 minutes then remove and discard berries. In a separate bowl combine:<br>
¾ cup sugar<br>
3 tablespoons cornstarch<br>
Add to juice in pan and stir to avoid clumps. Then add:<br>
2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>
Red food coloring<br>
Cook over high heat stirring constantly until thick and clear. Cool, then spoon over berries. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Yummy!
