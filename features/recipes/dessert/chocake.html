<b>Mom's Chocolate Cake</b><br>
<br>
"I've been baking this cake for 40 years," says Diana. "It has the best, easiest and fastest frosting on earth. This frosting makes other frostings you've eaten taste sick! Also, I never cook without at least doubling the recipe so I don't have to cook everyday. I freeze the extras so that I'm prepared for serving others in their home, at church or at school. It also means that I always have food ready for the Sabbath."<br>

1/3 cups cocoa<br>
½ cup butter or margarine<br>
½ cup milk<br>
1 Tablespoon Karo syrup<br>
