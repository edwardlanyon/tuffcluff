<b>Deep Fat Fried Mars Bars (AKA: Heart Attack on a Plate)</b><br>
<br>
Most people think they're just a rumor--but they really do exist! This fantastic recipe comes from Scotland (where else?). It's said that they're outlawed in England--so people have to travel all the way up to Scotland to get their fix. Chocolate, fish 'n' chip batter and super heated oil may not sound nice (or even culinarily possible) but it works--and they're glorious. They taste like a gooey version of pain au chocolat--so you know it will be good!<br>
<br>
Batter:<br>
1 egg<br>
1 cup milk <br>
1 Tbsp. vegetable oil<br>
1 cup flour<br>
1 tsp. baking powder<br>
Pinch salt<br>
<br>
Chocolate covered candy bar, chilled<br>
<br>
Combine egg, milk and oil in a small bowl. In a larger bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt. Mix wet and dry ingredients together and whisk. Cover and chill while heating oil. Use deep fat fryer or 4 cups of oil in a skillet at 385º. Dip chilled candy bar in batter then gently place in oil. Cook until outside is golden brown. Allow to cool and drain on paper. Watch out--it is VERY hot.
