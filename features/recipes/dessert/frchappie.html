<b>Mom's French Apple Pie</b><br>
<br>
“This isn’t the prettiest pie,” admits Diana, “but it’s full of rich, caramel-soaked apples that make it the best apple pie you’ve ever tasted. Depending on the apples you use, you might need to reduce the sugar. I always take it to pot-luck socials but no one ever eats it and now I see why; I have always taken it in a huge cast iron pot! Seeing a pie cooked in a pot scares people." <br>
<br>
In a bowl mix:<br>
6 or more sliced cooking apples (Granny Smith or Golden Delicious are good)<br>
½ cup sugar<br>
<br>
In a cast iron pot mix:<br>
1 cube butter (melted or chopped up)<br>
1 cup brown sugar<br> 
½ cup flour<br>
2/3 cup sugar<br>
Cinnamon <br>
Cloves<br>
<br>
Toss in apple mixture<br>
<br>
Pie crust:<br>
1 cup flour<br>
2 Tablespoons sugar<br>
1/3 cup lard<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
4-5 Tablespoons ice water<br>
<br>
<br>
Mix and roll out piecrust. Put piecrust over apple mixture in a cast iron chicken fryer. Bake at 350° for one hour or until pie bubbles for 10 minutes. Let it cool then serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
