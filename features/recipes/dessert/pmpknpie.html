<b>Holiday Pumpkin Pie</b><br>
<br>
This recipe is basically ripped off from the back of a Libby's can--but tastes just like mom used to make and it's the best!<br>
<br>
¾ cup sugar<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
1 ¾ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 can (15 oz.) pumpkin<br>
1 can (12 oz.) evaporated milk<br>
1 unbaked 9 inch pie shell (or 2 small shells)<br>
<br>
Mix sugar, salt and spices in a small bowl. Beat eggs in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually add evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell. Bake in a preheated 425º oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350º and bake 40-50 minutes until knife inserted comes out clean. Cool for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate. <br>
