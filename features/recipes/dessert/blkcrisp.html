<b>Mom's Brilliant Blackberry Crisp</b><br>
<br>
Kids always seem to lose track of time in the summer--but not at the Cluff house! You could always tell it was August because the Cluff kids couldn't come out to play--instead they wandered around with little perma-purple bleeding fingers and, despite the 110º heat, long-sleeved shirts, jeans and moon boots. It was blackberry harvest time! Every hot August hour of daylight was spent slaving away, picking bucket upon bucket--stripping every last blackberry bush within a twelve-mile radius of the house. And at the end of the day the ONLY thing that made it all worthwhile was Mom's brilliant blackberry crisp (and maybe <a href='icecream.html'>homemade ice cream</a> with crushed blackberries, too).<br>
<br> 
Preheat oven to 350º <br>
Grease a long pan then fill it with:<br>
6 cups blackberries<br>
1 cup sugar (on top of the fruit)<br>
<br>
In a bowl mix:<br>
2 cups brown sugar<br>
1 cup flour<br>
1 cup oatmeal<br>
1 cube margarine or butter<br>
1 tablespoon cinnamon<br>
<br>
Pour mixture over the fruit. Bake till bubbly (about 20-25 minutes). Best served warm with homemade vanilla ice cream. Yummy!
