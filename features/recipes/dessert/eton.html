<b>Eton Mess</b><br><br>
Each year at Britain’s most famous private school, Eton College (where the royals are schooled), the boys and their parents have a picnic featuring this traditional dessert. ‘According to Robin Weir in ‘Recipes From The Dairy’, Eton mess was served in the 1930s in the school's sock [sweet] shop, and was originally made with either strawberries or bananas mixed with ice cream or cream. Meringue was a later addition. Nowadays, Eton mess usually consists of pieces of crisp meringue, lightly whipped cream and strawberries, all stirred together - hence the name "mess".’ There are so many variations on this recipe that it's difficult to know which to use. But fear not because it's the kind of recipe that's difficult to get wrong. This particular variation has ice cream and comes from Harry Ramsden’s, the famous British fish and chips restaurant. It's not an official recipe, just what we figured we were eating. It's one of the scrummiest Summertime dessert you're ever likely to try!<br>
