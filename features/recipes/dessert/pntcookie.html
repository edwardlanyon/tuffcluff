<b>Peanut Butter Cookies</b><br>
<br>
An all-American favorite. If you're going for that authentic, peanut butter cookie look, the most important thing to remember is the criss-cross fork indentation on the top of each cookie. They just wouldn't be the same without it.<br>
<br>
1 cup peanut butter<br>
1 cup butter or margarine <br>
<br>
Beat these together in mixer at high speed for about 30 seconds. Then add:<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1 cup brown sugar<br>
1 tsp. baking soda<br>
1 tsp. baking powder<br>
<br>
Beat until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl often. Then beat in: <br>
2 eggs<br>
1 tsp. vanilla<br>
<br>
Slowly add:<br>
2 ½ cups of flour<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 375º<br>
Shape into 1 inch balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart then mash with a fork in criss cross pattern.  (I like to add a dollop of peanut butter or a small piece of chocolate). Bake for 7 to 9 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack or kitchen cloth.<br>
