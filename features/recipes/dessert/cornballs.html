<b>Old Fashioned Popcorn Balls</b><br>
<br>
Halloween just wouldn't be the same without these sticky little cornballs. <br>
<br>
2 quarts popped corn<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1/3 cup corn syrup<br>
1/3 cup water<br>
¼ cup butter<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla<br>
<br>
In a 2 quart saucepan, stir together sugar, syrup, water, butter and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture comes to a boil (270° on a candy thermometer or until syrup dropped into cold water separates into hard--but not brittle--threads). Remove from heat. Add vanilla, stirring just enough to mix with hot syrup. Slowly pour over popcorn, stirring to coat every kernel. Cool enough to handle. Shape into balls with buttered hands. Cool on wax paper or foil. Makes about 12 medium.
