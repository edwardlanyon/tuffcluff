<b>Karen's Chocolate Chip Cookies</b><br>
<br>
I want to put a disclaimer on this batch of cookies. I am not responsible for the clogged arteries, spare tires or saddlebags that will result from addiction to and overindulgence in these cookies. And as always, consult your dietitian before hand for appropriate dosage of the cookie. For those of you familiar with weight watcher’s point system, these cookies count as about 12 points each. Enjoy!<br>
<br> 
In the Kitchen Aid:<br> 
1 C margarine<br>
1 C shortening that is not all veggie oils<br>
 <br>
Mix until smooth and pale yellow.  Keep mixing as you add:<br>
1 ½ C sugar<br>
1 ½ C brown sugar<br>
 <br>
Keep mixing and add:<br>
3 eggs, one at a time<br>
2 lids full of vanilla<br>
 <br>
In a separate bowl mixed together:<br>
4 ½ C Flour<br>
2 tsp. baking soda<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
<br> 
Add the flour mixture slowly to the butter mixture. When it is blended, add 1/2 bag of chocolate chips, semi-sweet are always in mine, but you can use milk chocolate if you want. Bake at 375° until they are puffy and slightly brown on the edges. I have a convection oven which cooks 3 racks at once at 350° and boy are they perfect! Cool on a rack so the underside does not get soggy. Remember to eat responsibly.
