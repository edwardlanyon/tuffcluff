<b>Brer Rabbit's Whip-Me Whop-Me Puddin'</b><br>
<br>
If we were very good at bedtime and had brushed our teeth without being asked, Dad would settle down in the hallway (a neutral position between the three bedrooms) and tell us stories about Brer Rabbit. One of our favorites was the 'whip-me whop-me pudding' story. One night when had been really super-duper extra good, Dad actually made the 'whip-me whop-me pudding' for us--which was a big mistake because we begged for it every night from there on out--and this is the recipe. <br>
<br>
½ cup sugar<br>
6 tablespoons corn starch<br>
¼ teaspoon salt<br>
4 cups milk<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla<br>
<br>
Mix dry ingredients together then, stirring vigorously with a whisk, combine with milk in saucepan or double boiler over low heat. Stir for 8-12 minutes until mixture begins to thicken. Cover and cook for 10 more minutes. Then stir 1 cup of mixture into 2 well-beaten eggs. Return to main mixture and cook 2 more minutes - stirring constantly. Do NOT overcook (the pudding will thicken as it cools). Remove from heat, add vanilla and continue to stir for 1 minute while it cools. Pour into serving dishes and let cool in the refrigerator. Makes 8 servings.
