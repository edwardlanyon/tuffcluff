<b>Tiana's Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</b><br>
 <br>
Here’s an amazing, excellent, delicious, incredible oatmeal cookie recipe that Hyrum and I LOVE!!!! It would be a good base for a chocolate chip cookie also (just use chocolate chips instead of raisins). Watch out…if you make these, you’ll easily eat a dozen before you realize it. This recipe comes from the Ashland 2nd Ward cook book. I’ve modified it a little: I changed the oats to old-fashioned and the nuts to raisins and I reorganized the order of ingredients because it was mixed up from the way it should have been.<br>
 <br>
2 cups shortening<br>
2 cups sugar<br>
2 cups brown sugar<br>
4 eggs<br>
2 tsp. vanilla<br>
4 cups flour<br>
2 tsp. salt<br>
2 tsp. baking soda<br>
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats <br>
1 cup raisins<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350°. Cream the shortening and sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Sift together flour, salt, and soda. Add to creamed mixture. Stir in oats and raisins. Mix well. Drop onto ungreased cookie sheets and cook at 350° for 10 minutes.
