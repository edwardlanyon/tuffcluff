<b>Mom's Famous Taffy</b><br>
<br>
WARNING: You are not allowed to make this taffy unless you have a full working knowledge of the trials, tribulations and taffy-making habits of the Cluff and George ancestors going back at least twelve generations. And that's not all. You must be able to communicate your knowledge in a fascinating and spirited oration that is able to capture the interest of all age groups--including teenagers! See Mom for more info.<br>
<br>
2 cups sugar<br>
¼ cups corn syrup<br>
2 tablespoons vinegar<br>
2 ¼ cups water<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla (pour in after cooking)<br>
butter<br>
<br>

Set aside a glass of cold water and a spoon to test the taffy throughout the cooking process. Put all ingredients in a saucepan and stir. Cook on stove at high, till mixture boils. Cover with a lid and turn down to medium-high heat. After 5 minutes take lid off and keep cooking till hard crack. It should take no longer than 15 minutes to cook (you will see millions of white bubbles when the taffy is about done). Check a spoon full of taffy in the cold water to see if it chips when it hits the rim of the glass. If it breaks it's at the hard crack stage and you will only have a minute to pour the taffy onto a buttered medium sized platter or pan. <br>

Once the taffy has cooled enough to pull, spread a little butter on hands and pull until it's white and hard. Put pulled taffy on wax paper or a buttered dish to keep it from sticking. You can shape your taffy however you like. The easiest is to make a rope and section off pieces with knife marks. Once taffy is hard, hit the knife marks with the handle of a table knife and you will have neat little pieces. This recipe serves a small group.
