<b>Caramel Chews</b><br>
<br>
Mom makes these tempting little treats for Christmas each year. They're deliciously chewy and ohh so sticky--but NOT for the dentally challenged.<br>
<br>
½ cup butter<br>
1 cup walnuts<br>
½ cup light corn syrup <br>
½ can (¾ cup) sweetened condensed milk<br>
1 cup packed brown sugar<br>
½ teaspoon vanilla<br>
<br>
Butter an 8" baking pan. Add nuts to pan and shake to settle in an even layer on bottom of pan. Set aside. Put remaining butter and corn syrup in a 2-3 quart heavy metal pan. Cook, stirring over medium heat, till butter melts. Add milk, brown sugar, and vanilla. Stir to smoothly blend. Cool at least 2 hours. Cut into 1" squares. Wrap individually if desired. Store in a cool, dry place (for up to 1 week) or freeze for longer storage. Makes 5 dozen.
