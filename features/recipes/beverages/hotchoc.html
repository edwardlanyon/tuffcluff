<b>Hot Chocolate</b><br>
<br>
Our annual Christmas tree trek just wouldn't be the same without this recipe. We always started with a traditional hot chocolate and <a href='chili.html'>chilli</a> lunch before Dad would lead the way through the deep snow and into the far reaches of the wilderness in pursuit of the perfect tree. For the rest of this story go to the <a href='../famtrad.html'>family traditions page</a>.<br> 
<br>
½ cup chocolate baking power<br>
Sugar (to taste)<br>
Milk<br>
Mini-marshmallows or whipped topping (optional)<br>
<br>
Mix chocolate power with sugar to desired sweetness. Stir mixture into hot milk on the stove--but don't let it boil. Tune chocolately/sugary taste until just right. Top with mini-marshmallows or whipped topping. Serves about 12 people.
