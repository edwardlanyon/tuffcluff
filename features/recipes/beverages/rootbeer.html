<b>Homemade Rootbeer</b><br>
<br>
Homemade rootbeer is great anytime of the year, but it's a Cluff tradition to make it on Halloween. This is mainly because the rootbeer making process produces a thick, foggy vapor by-product that looks just like the smoke from a witch's cauldron. The kids love it. <br>
<br>
Cold water<br>
4-5 lbs. sugar <br>
1 small bottle of Hires rootbeer flavoring <br>
5 lb. block of dry ice <br>
<br>
Fill a five gallon container 2/3 full of water. Add sugar, rootbeer extract, and medium chunks of dry ice from the larger block. Be very careful handling the dry ice and never use your bare hands! Stir and watch it smoke and bubble, then serve.<br>
<br>
Mom's themey tips: (as always, not recommended by the majority of Cluffs)<br>
Wear a witch's hat, wild green teeth, a warty nose and long, fake fingernails. Make a few wild laughs from time to time to show off your green teeth. Bend over the smoky pot and stir, menacingly, then serve. Play spooky Halloween music and have strange decor on the table (bats, snakes, jack-o-lanterns, candles etc.)<br>
