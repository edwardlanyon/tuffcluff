<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
My three year old has been recently toilet trained.  Following my mother’s advice, I put a long shirt on the child and let him run around without clothing on the bottom half.  Now that the he is potty trained, I can’t seem to get clothes to remain on him.  After finishing his business, he takes off all his clothes instead of pulling up his shorts.  Then he runs around naked until I can catch him and dress him again.  Recently a somber pair of  Jehovah’s Witnesses came knocking.  As I opened the door my naked son tore out of the house and made a dash for the street.  The startled Jehovah’s witnesses quickly handed me their pamphlet as I darted by to capture the bare boy before he could stop traffic again.  The last time a scowling old lady got out of her car, but I escaped with the boy back into the house before she could hobble over to give me a piece of her mind.

Dear EmBAREassed,<br>
Your mother's behavior is not acceptable, and she must be encouraged to cover up and stop advising others to act in this disreputable manner. That said, you do seem to have stumbled upon an extraordinarily good way to prevent the Jehovah's witnesses ever returning. I would suggest that you arrange for the entire family to adopt this eccentric behavior whenever unwanted visitors come a-knockin’. I tried it myself last night... and it'll be quite some time before those pesky scouts come peddling their cookies round here again!!

My husband has a nasty habit that drives me crazy; he's a serial toenail clipper! He makes me so mad with all the time he spends clipping and grooming his toenails, plus he never cleans them up! Sometimes he leaves a little pile of toenails on our dining room table for me to clean up! I just can't bear it anymore. I am fed up! Help me Agony Aunt, what can I do to get my husband back for all his nasty toenail related activities?!!!<br>

Dear DQ,<br>
Since your hubby insists upon leaving his mess on the dining table, why not keep with the theme and make him a toenail soufflé? You could also sprinkle the offending objects over his cornflakes or pack them in his sandwich. Perhaps try collecting all the clippings you can get your hands on then discreetly putting them in places that will make HIM uncomfortable, like in a pile on his side of the bed, in his shoes or glued to his steering wheel. He'll get the idea soon enough.

<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
I'm a natural fashion trend-setter and people always copy my ideas. For instance, in 1993 I wore a wide-brimmed beach hat draped with yards of flowing fabric and started a trend that lasted for a decade and spanned several continents. Also, I'm the one who started the whole poncho revival of 2004. The problem is, I'm not getting any credit or financial compensation for my brilliant ideas. What should I do?<br>

Dear Ms Off,<br>
You should cover yourself by carefully documenting each outfit you go out in with photographs, fabric swatches and patents - that way you'll have legal recourse when someone rips you off and be entitled to the financial compensation you so desperately seek.<br>

<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
I'm a great reader and enjoy taking a book with me wherever I go in case there is a lull and I need something to occupy me. The problem is that my five year old sister, who can barely read, has started copying me. She carries books around that are way out of her depth and pretends to read them, turning the pages quickly like she's really fast - just to annoy me. Half the time her books are upsidedown! I can't stand it so I quiz her on the content, but she never knows what's going on in the plot. It's so annoying! What should I do?<br>

Dear BB,<br>
Immitation is the most sincere form of flattery, however, it is also extremely annoying. It's obvious your sister sees you as a cool trendsetter, so the thing to do is to ditch the books and pick up a bizarre and even disgusting hobby like armpit fluffing, nose whistling or picking fake lice from your hair. When your sister asks why you're not reading anymore, just say that you've moved on to the next big thing. She'll take the bait and be hooked, but once people start mocking her for her new disgusting hobby, she'll gradually come to the realization that you're a weirdo and not worth copying. Once this happens you can go back to your beloved books - but this time in peace!<br>

<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
I can't seem to persuade people to listen to my ideas now that I've reached a certain age. Surely my achievements are more worthy of merit now that I have the benefit of old age and wisdom on my side, but no one seems to care. For example, I, without even the benefit of a college education, have devised:<br>
 - a cure for the common cold<br>
 - a cheap alternative to messy and expensive anti-perspirants<br>
 - effective ways to serve decaying chicken to my family<br>
 - exciting morality stories to keep children on the path of righteousness<br>
 - how to look decades younger using just shoulder pads, rubber bands and vaseline<br>
and yet I can persuade nobody to listen to me!!!! Please tell me what I should do!!!<br>

<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
I'm living at my Grandma's house for the summer and there's nothing to eat in the house. It's not like they don't have any food (they have 3 refrigerators and two chest freezers full) but most of it is disgusting, moldy or past its sell-by date. It makes me want to barf. I'm a growing teenage boy and need sustenance! How can I be expected to live on <a href='../cafe/recipes/granola.html'>granola</a>, yams and mulch casserole and keep my weight above 98 lbs?<br>

Hungry & Homesick</b> <br><br>
Dear Sick,<br>
Buck up little camper! Food that's gone off is good for your immune system. It works in much the same way that inoculations do--a bit of it now will help you to build resistance, or immunity, to food poisoning for the rest of your life. Think of it as intestinal boot-camp. But if you must have something edible now and again to sustain your dwindling weight I suggest handfuls of sugar for quick energy and lard to slow the weight loss. Good luck.<br>

My twin brother 'Rufus'* insists on dressing the same as me, even though I'm eleven years old now. How can I get him to stop? I've already tried violence. <br>

Carbon Copied </b> <br> <br>
Dear CC, <br>
Your problem sounds serious, but violence is never the answer. Why don't you try something a bit more creative? The best way of dealing with a copycat is to get rid of their ammunition. Have you tried burning the clothes that match yours so he'll be forced to wear something else? That's non-contact and a lot of fun, but it isn't very ecologically friendly. If you care about the planet, perhaps you should think about shredding his clothes then making them into a rag-rug or a quilt for the needy.<br>

<b>Dear Agony Aunt,<br>
I like the wild jungle look in my landscaping and don't believe in trimming hedges or bushes. Over the years many people have come to my house armed with clippers and trimmers and hacked away at my foliage. I'm sure they are trying to being charitable by helping with my overgrown yard, but I hate the naked/groomed look and just want everything to be left wild, natural and free! How can I either let them know that this bothers me or get even?!<br>

Cut Down In My Prime</b> <br><br>  
Dear Prime Cut,<br>
When your friends, neighbors and relatives all feel the need to trim your exterior ornamental vegetation for you, it's time to re-think your yardal arrangement. However, that's beside the point. What you need is a pair of very sharp scissors, a bobby pin or credit card, some dark clothing and a bottle of chloroform. Put on your dark clothing, go out after midnight, pick the offender's lock, make your way to their bedroom with your chloroform ready and knock them out. Once they're down you can relax and get creative with the scissors. Go ahead and do to them what they did to your hedges. Try a flat top, a buzz, a close shave or even a multi-tiered topiary. This kind of revenge is fun, therapeutic and recommended for victims of all ages.<br>

Recently my baby was very sick and needed antibiotics but it was the weekend and I couldn't take him to the doctor. I was horrified when a relation of mine seriously suggested feeding my baby moldy bread to get the antibiotic effect! Is there any authenticity in this claim?!<br>
Signed,<br>
</b>Muddled Up Mama<br>
<br>  
Dear Mud,<br>
According to Steve, a research microbiologist from www.bio.net, <i>"Mold which commonly grows on bread in the lab is called Penicillium. This is the genus from which penicillin, the antibiotic, was first isolated. Some of the Penicillium molds are green, others grey, and even white. The reason you can't eat moldy bread when you are sick and get an antibiotic is that only very specific Penicillium molds make penicillin when they grow. Others make poisonous by-products when they grow."</i><br>
You were right to be horrified. Even if you hit the jackpot and had cultivated the right kind of mold, what about dosage? I'm sure you would have ended up in a courtroom trying to explain why you poisoned your baby. Next time your relative prescribes something - ask them to demonstrate its effectiveness by taking it his/herself first.
