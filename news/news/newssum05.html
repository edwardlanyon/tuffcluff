<a class=times15><center>Ten Wild Kids, One Fantasic Voyage </center></a>
</center><img src="Pictures/sailboat.jpg" align=left>"Listen up swabbies," the invitation began. "Take the oath now and sign it in blood!  If ye can't, then stay behind with the other yeller bellied landlubbers drudging out their days respiring flatulent from behind a mule dragging a dusty, broken plow in endless circles in the quest of meager seasonal crops.  Then let your mind wander to the brave lassies and laddies breath'n the clean salt air of your ancestral home; a fresh breeze on their cheeks, sails cracking, bound for exotic harbors, new worlds and lobster for $4 a pound!" Nine lucky TuffCluff kids (Dallas, Weston, Nial, Ammon, Kaylynn, Braden, Jasmine, Cage and Dakota) responded to the invitation of a  lifetime and got to go sailing off the coast of Maine with their very brave Uncle Randy and his daughter, Emma. Their journey consisted of learning to sail, exploring, eating, shopping, stargazing, eating, participating in various exciting nautical diversions (knot tying, tacking, swabbing etc) and eating. High points included stirring up bioluminescence, exploring historical sites in Boston and dolphin spotting while low points included a few mild cases of seasickness and a nasty clogged-toilet incident. The kids had too much fun to feel any pangs of homesickness, much to the chagrin of their parents, and felt the trip was over all too soon. All in all, it was a fantastic experience for every lad and lass.

Tabitha Lanyon, at the tender age of only four months, has her own action figure. Her parents found the 99 cent "Mini Me" doll while on vacation in Oregon. Tabitha's mother picked out the doll because she thought it was adorable but failed to make the uncanny connection until several people commented on its likeness to Tabitha. Though collecting royalties from the toy manufacturer for the use of Tabitha's face was suggested, the Lanyons are more interested in the doll's voodoo potential in case Tabitha becomes an unruly teenager.

"This summer," says a weary Diana "our home was turned into a teenaged rock joint, with the boy's friends watching loud movies, laughing, eating everything, wrestling, blasting music and constantly playing video games. I'm not sure I'll survive the rest of the summer and am really looking forward to the new school year!" For anyone thinking of having children in their late 40's (especially male children) please do the math first: 47 (age at conception) + 13 (obnoxious teenage phase) = 60 (quiet, childless golden years meant for cruises and flower arranging).

He listened so much that his CD player bit the dust. I bought him a new CD player and in a week or so he'd finished the whole book. He has now given his scripture CDs to Dallas." They are currently collecting dust.

<b>Three Teenage Boys Discover Raunchy Bible Stories</b><br> In their short lives, Nial, Dallas and Weston have spent more time in scripture study than a monastery full of elderly Monks with sunshine allergies. However, it's only recently that they've discovered the seedier side of the scriptures because, up until now, they've miraculously managed to avoid the Old Testament. "We've been reading the Bible as a family," says religious mother of ten, Diana, "and our teenaged boys have been shocked by some of the things in its text. They were most appalled by the rated R stories of Sodom and Gomorrah and Lot's daughters. They kept saying 'sick!' and Nial kept wanting to stop reading [though, to be fair, this is nothing out of the ordinary]. Later, I heard him asking his friends, 'Have you read the Bible lately?!'." The Cluffs are now considering imposing a curfew on the Old Testament in an effort to curb the boy's newfound fondness for sneaking the book into their rooms after midnight for a little late night reading!!

<a class=times15><center>Twins Attacked By Wild Animal</center></a>
One hot day, Dallas, Weston and Nial decided to go camping in the wilderness together. They set out for the Klamath River but, being true Cluffs, left late. Their problems were compounded after stopping to get Taco Bell on the way, which not only made them later but also gave them gas. They arrived well after dark, hot and stinky. They were about to pitch their tent when they saw an old shack with some wild people nearby and reluctantly decided it might be better to stay in their tiny car despite the smell. Weston drew the short straw and had to sleep in the back seat while Nial and Dallas fully reclined into his three-inches of space. Needless to say it was not most comfortable of nights. The next morning the twins headed straight for the Klamath river to swim. Nial decided to stay dry and fish from the riverbank. "Nial was fishing," recalls the boy's nervous mother, Diana, "when suddenly the twins began screaming like they were being eaten by a crock! They had come face to face with a big swimming snake in the river. They thought it was a rattle snake. The twins separated. Weston headed for shore and jumped out right into stinging nettle. Dallas took off in a wild upstream swim with the snake just behind him." Nial said the twins swam like they were on the swim team and screamed like they were six year old girls - he enjoyed the view. But the twins didn't enjoy the experience and have crossed the Klamath River off their list of favorite places to camp.

<img src="Pictures/tiakids.jpg" align=left>
<b>Tiana volunteered to look after four of her nieces and nephews while their mother took a break for a few months. The events that followed are chronicled in the following excerpts.</b> From left to right: Talea (1), Sabreena (2), Arrianna (3), Rueben (5), Vincent (9)<br>

<b>Day 15</b> It's been going pretty well, although I have had a few rough days. If I had had more than a just a few hours to prepare for the experience of having this many kids, I could have been organized and ready, but since it happened in a matter of hours, my life has pretty much been chaotic for the last couple weeks. <br>

<b>Day 27</b> Indian and Scout just gave birth to 5 puppies each, but Scout's last one was a still born. It was all puffy and distorted. Not to be mean, but it looked just like Jabba the Hut. All 9 of the remaining puppies are black/tan except for one red.  These will most likely be our last litters.<br>

<b>Day 32</b> Now if I can just fix food exactly the way the kids have always had it, I'll have them satisfied! That'll never happen I'm afraid. (I folded quesadillas instead of rolling them for goodness sake! What trauma!) <br>

<b>Day 38</b> The amount of crying/clinginess and quantity of snot that can come out of 3 small girls is astounding! I carry a large wad of TP in my pocket all day. They must have allergies or something lately!<br>

<b>Day 41</b> Well, I'm prego again! It was a shock because I didn't use fertility! What timing! <br>

<b>Day 44</b> Mom spent two days up here cleaning my house and doing yard work because it's been such a pigsty from the remodel and I don't have time to work in the yard so it's overgrown and dying, and my garden was choked with weeds until the missionaries mercifully came and deweeded it. <br>

<b>Day 47</b> There's only about 2 rooms in my house that are not cluttered with unpacked boxes or messes. Talea's room is painted with a cute barnyard scene, so it's the only room I can be proud of at this point. It's also the playroom, and since Hyrum shows it off to people I have to bark at the kids to pick up the toys all the time. <br>

<b>Day 54</b> Gotta go feed my herd. I have them eat on the trampoline then hose them down after they're done to clean them up.<br>

<b>Day 60</b> I'm not a super woman. It's almost noon, I'm still in sleepwear, my hair isn't combed, but I am showered, I rarely wear makeup anymore. I feel like a frazzeled mom who can barely keep up. <br>

<b>Day 71</b> Just found out that the cat is pregnant<br>

<b>Day 72</b> I'm only having two kids!<br>

<a class=times15><center>4th of July Report</center>
</a><img src="Pictures/4th.jpg" align=left> 		
"Four of our adult children's families came for the 4th of July this year," reports Diana. "Shira drove herself five hours from Portland with Sofia in the back seat. Natasha, Steve, Cage, and Dru came from San Diego and played Summer Santa to our boys with great gifts of a playstation, games and shirts. Our boys think Steve rocks! Tiana and Hyrum came with their daughter and the four adorable children they are tending. Dane and Karen came down with their five children (two of which are driving teens now) too. To accommodate everyone we had a big tent set up on the lawn as well as the trampoline, six couches in the livingroom, the loft, the motorhome and two spare bedrooms. Dane and Karen got stuck with the nasty boy's bedroom. It was trashed - even though I had spent hours cleaning it. Oh well, win some, lose some. On the morning of the Fourth I woke everyone up by blasting patriotic music on all of our speakers. Then we all ran off to the parade, which was the best ever with Mexicans, Hawaiians and Hell's Angles on their bikes. We had our picnic in the park at the bandshell with a wonderful brass band from Seattle. We had our taffy pull, laughed and caught up with our lives, watched a Fourth of July movie, had great wrestlers of America, wild family dances, ate a lot and visited. Later we went to the fireworks at Walker School. Dane's clever parking ensured that we beat the traffic jam home afterwards, a first for us. The Fourth is a good time for our family get-togethers, as the town is fun and the weather is good."

Melanie, Scott and their three children made the trek across the Atlantic to Britain early this summer. They seemed to enjoy visiting London and the English countryside and have expressed an interest in going back again soon. Mel and Scott said their favorite sight was Westminster Abbey, Soren liked Stonehenge and the London Eye, Kira couldn't choose between The Lion King play or The New Forest (with the wild ponies) and Joseph seemed to like the Science Museum. "I could easily live there!" Melanie says with a dreamy look in her eyes.

Edward was stunned at the end of the vacation to discover that it was his first trip the West Coast that didn't involve a vehicular break down of some sort - but it was also his first trip that didn't rely on Cluffportation. So that explains it!

"The Elmont George reunion in Ashland was fun," reports Diana.

Even Nial said the reunion was great - so you know it was good. The Sevey reunion in the Redwoods was fun too. It was great to catch up with our relatives."

The mysterious allure of owning a chicken seems to be to great to resist for most Cluffs. Nevermind that it was a complete and utter nightmare growing up with chickens, the urge to farm feathered fleabags runs too deep too fight. "We got two teenager-size chickens on Monday," says tract-home farmer, Tiana," and by Friday one of them had already disappeared. Maybe it's the Cluff curse that chickens try to escape or get killed so easily."

"We went to San Francisco for Kathleen's wedding and stayed in Randy's seven story home on Lombard Street," says Diana. "While we were there a burger [burlgar?] came and I had to comfort [confront?] him. He sounded English and spoke with politeness to me after I caught him. He said he had gotten the wrong roof. When I asked him where he was from he said 'planet Earth'. He was shirtless, had a big chain around his neck and a huge balancing stick that he probably used to pole vault from rooftop to rooftop, break windows and kill grandmothers with. He left before I could do anything. Randy wondered why I didn't attack him, I told him I thought that I might get bludgeoned to death with his stick. It reminded me of why we moved away from the city with its more frequent weirdoes." <hr>

<a class=times15><center>Tiana: Mother of 24</center></a><img src="Pictures/tiakids.jpg" align=left>
"At one point we had 25 heartbeats at our house," says an exhausted Tiana. "This is how it broke down: 1 fish, 1 chicken, 1 cat, 3 kittens, 7 puppies, 4 dogs, 4 Garcia kids, Hyrum, Talea, the new baby, and me. If we hadn't sold 2 puppies a couple days before the kittens were born and we got Piper (a puppy we're dog-sitting), we would have had 27 heartbeats at the house. Talk about white trash! We went from trucker trash to trailer trash to white trash! I just need a couple lawn flamingos and we're set. We're just one big breeding ground aren't we? - first the dogs, then the cat, then me. The chicken should be laying eggs, but I think she's mad that she's the only chicken, so she's holding out. At least they won't be fertilized!"

<a class=times15><center>Losing A Limb</center></a>
"We are trying to spare our home from trees falling on it," says worried mother, Diana, "by sending Nial up trees to do some chainsaw pruning. His mountain climbing skills are coming in handy as he balances in the trees with a heavy chainsaw and the twins use their scouting knots to wrap rope around the big branches to make the limbs miss the roof as they fall." In the process of saving the house the Cluffs may lose a son, but it's a risk they are willing to take given that they have several spare boys and only one house.

Nial is working on his Eagle project (making a trail through poison oak in the park) and hopes to finish before he turns 18 and is no longer eligible (in Feb). The twins, 13, are now Life Scouts and almost as close to getting their Eagle as Nial. "Weston, Nial and I should all be getting our 'egels' by the end of this year," reports Dallas. No one like scouts more than the boy's mother, Diana. "The twins just went to Scout Camp," she says. "They do such fun things in Scouts like take jet boats down the Rogue River, camp on the beach and take four wheelers to surf behind at the dunes. I love Scouts, it really is what a boys needs to grow up with because it has the right kind of boys doing great boy-things that make them into men. Thank you England, for inventing Scouts!" <i>Watch this column to keep up on the boy's progress.

"Marriage comes with all sorts of differences that we have to accept even though we feel like putting a rotten tomato in their lunch box because they aren't like us! Everyone should be glad that we are all so different, but if you aren't, here's a tip on getting your husband to change. Serve a nice meal, then ask if it would be okay to study lessons on life together for 5 minutes each day after dinner. Start with the biggest problems you have. Use books from the library or magazines so it won't be lessons from "you". Kiss after the lesson and say thanks for the study time together. Serve dessert after the lesson, as it keeps your partner at the table for the lesson. If they have a bad attitude, next time add ex-lax or kidney dye to their dinner."

<a class=times15><center>"Surprise" Birthday</center></a><img src="Pictures/bday.jpg" align=left>
This August Dennis turned 66 and had a "surprise" birthday party - not surprise in the traditional sense, just bizarre and unexpected. Weeks earlier Diana had asked what he wanted for his birthday and he had very sensibly thought it would be nice to replace their filthy, old, splintering, cider-barrel hot tub. Unfortunately, Diana disapproved on the grounds that nothing was bigger or better than the one they already owned. (In actual fact, even a cow trough filled with sulfur water is nicer!) <img src="../../Pictures/dennis.jpg" align=right> So he suggested a laser pen for pointing out the stars to the family, but Diana had heard that people flash the pens in pilot’s faces and get arrested, so she shot down that idea too. Finally he settled on something that couldn't possibly cause controversy, a picture frame with a photo of his family for his office. When Dennis's birthday finally rolled around and he opened his presents he got a photo album (not a frame) without photos, a shirt that was two sizes too small and a collection of Halloween sundries; a Dracula mask, a warty troll mask and a scull goblet. There may be someone out there who would prefer a Halloween mask to a hot tub, but we’ve never met them. At least it was an unforgettable birthday!
