</center><img src="Pictures/nerd.jpg" align=left>
"Being a clean nerd is the new popular thing these days," says relieved mother of ten, Diana. "The Twins have made up clean words to say at school and now the whole school is copying them! It's nice to have that nasty, filthy language finally replaced." But contrary to popular belief this 'new' curse replacement trend is as old as the twins themselves. "It's actually just our twin language," reveals Weston with a smug grin. "Dallas and I would be taking to each other while our friends were around and they'd hear us using our twin-talk and then they just started copying us. It was pretty funny at first but then it got really weird because one morning I was just getting to school and some random girl saw me and suddenly shouted, 'what the foo?!' which was one of OUR things! And I didn't even know her!" As a phrase, 'what the foo?' is as complicated as it is peculiar. In twin-talk 'foo' is a not-so-clever variant of 'fool' - but then the clever bit comes in when it's twisted to be unrecognizable in an unlikely phrase (ie: 'what the foo?!'). This catchy phrase became so popular that it wasn't long before even elementary school children were heard saying it! The boys have revealed their top cussing substitutes as: foo & fooster (variants of fool), feak (variant of freak), ‘ate yee (hate you) and kibbin'(just kidding). Dallas admits that it's Weston's thing more than his but is still a keen participant and is proud that their language has gone mainstream. "It's pretty sweet," he says with a satisfied look in his eye, "but I always knew we'd be famous one day.” Then suddenly, “Hold on! Wait a sec! Did you say just say that Mom thinks we're nerds?!" He looks crestfallen and gives a teary, doe-eyed look that would make a rock weep, and then, "Haa! Kibbin! Better a nerd than a feak!" If you can come up with anything better, we'd love to hear it!

"After having had 25 heartbeats in the house last summer," says an exhausted Tiana, "I'm going to get all three of my dogs fixed so there won't be anymore puppies."

<a class=times15><center>NEW JOHNSON BABY: Hyatt Dennis</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/hyabb.jpg" align=left>
Congratulations to Tiana and Hyrum who's new baby boy, Hyatt Dennis, was born on April 3rd. "He weighed in at 6 pounds 14 ounces," reports Hyrum, "and was 19.5 inches long. He was delivered with the cord around his neck twice so he had to fight for his first breaths. Tiana didn’t get to see him for the first three hours and was getting anxious." When Tiana finally did get to see her new baby for the first time they bonded instantly despite the fact that she had labored for nearly 30 hours and was holding a bit of a grudge. One look at her precious baby boy and she knew he had been worth all the extra trouble. "His first name is Hyatt," Tiana says, "so he can be named after his Daddy (Hyrum) without continuing the Hyrum name for the 5th time (hi-5), and his middle name is Dennis because we wanted to honor his Grandpa Cluff by continuing his name. He looks a lot like Talea did, except he has the Cluff nose instead of the Johnson nose. He’s a very good baby, thank goodness! Talea loves having a baby brother that’s “her” baby."

<a class=times15><center>Mel's Second Trip to England</center></a>
"The night before arriving in Cornwall," Melanie remembers, "whilst en route, Edward had a small automobile nudging, resulting in a scratched bumper on our side, a cracked bumper and broken blinker light on theirs and a very bruised ego on Edward’s side.  The rental car, which only had 200 miles on it, had to be written off as un-rentable after our little accident - though the damage was very slight.  So Edward essentially “totaled” a car! Here are my favorite highlights from the places we visited:"<br>

<b>CORNWALL</b>: "<b>Tintagel</b>, King Arthur’s birthplace and where he was crowned.  Also, the birthplace of JoJo’s water obsession: JoJo almost stepped off the jagged coastal edge as he tried to dive into a little creek that immediately plunged into the craggy bay below. <b>Boscastle</b>, Dakota’s favorite town in Cornwall.  We had a brisk walk to the North view point where you could probably fly your dog like a kite on his leash in the wind! <b>Porthcurno Valley Telegraph Station</b>.  An unimpressed ticketing clerk couldn’t care less that Edward’s Grandfather was intimately involved with the station’s history. Cream tea at the <b>Lanyon Farmhouse</b> and a hike to the <b>Lanyon Quoit</b>.  Tour of the <b>Lanyon Manor House</b> surrounded by fields of blooming daffodils. <b>St. Michaels Mount</b> with the giants heart turned to stone and the secret garden. Hiking down to <b>Kynance Cove</b>, Edward’s Favorite beauty spot in Cornwall.  My legs felt so sore from hiking with Joseph on my hip. <b>Land’s End</b> and the <b>Lizard</b>, the <b>Minack Theatre</b> (which I loved), and the <b>Merry Maidens</b> (Dakota’s traditional Cornish rest stop for relieving himself). I absolutely loved the quality of the light in Cornwall, especially by the seaside.  I wished there were Cluffs of Cornwall.  We tried to hike to a point that was labeled <b>“Carn Clough”</b> on a map we had, but the natives told us it was just the bluffs and not named for the family. We went to Cornwall for the views but will go back for the food; the rock candy, Cornish cream teas, the pasties and especially the Cornish ice cream!" <br> 
<img src="Pictures/cotswolds.jpg" align=left>
<b>THE COTSWOLDS</b> (with Mark and Elizabeth too): "<b>Hidcote Manor Gardens</b>, where I saw my first real Haha. We had scones and jam and cream in the tea shop. I wondered what my house would look like covered in roses and wisteria. <b>St. Peter’s church</b> in Gloucestershire. After the church tour we had lunch with a chewy mint to finish off the meal, but it did more than just finish off the meal-it finished off my tooth too as I lost my temporary crown in an overzealous bite! <b>Filkins</b>, the market cross.  The idea was that all transactions would be fair and honest if done near the cross.  <b>Stow-on-the-Wold</b> had village stocks we tried to put Dakota and Joseph into. While backing up to get a perfect picture of the cottages at <b>Arlington Row</b> I nearly stepped into the stream behind me. Daisha’s favorite. <b>Snowshill</b>:  It actually snowed while we crossed the tops of the lavender fields in Snowshill. Mark and Elizabeth took me to <b>Statford-upon-Avon</b>, also <b>John Harvard’s birthplace</b>.  JoJo had two massive tantrums during our tour of <b>Mary Arden’s</b> home. The Tudor style is so “English”.  All of the Cotswold’s remind me of storybook pictures."<br>

<b>DAYTRIPS</b> (with Daisha): "<b>Windsor</b>: I nearly got run over by a car in Windsor (bloody tourist!) <b>Knole</b>, Sevenoaks: We took the children’s tour (American style) so that we didn’t have to read big academic descriptions of each room! Edward was unimpressed with this clever trick of ours! Poor me. English “dud” shampoo caused flat hair all day long (or maybe low water pressure!). <b>Emmets Garden</b>: The views were lovely, but all Joseph was interested in was the dog water bowl. We did an Easter egg hunt and received Dairy milk chocolates at end (Dakota’s favorite part). I tried to recognize where scenes of favorite film “A Room With a View” was shot. We dined on fish and chips at Harry Ramsdens finishing off the meal with <a href='../../house/recipes/dessert/eton.html'>Eton Mess!</a> <b>Penshurst Place and Gardens</b>: Alice in Wonderland-like with long mazey hedges. The Great Hall had an ancient roof where the smoke filtered out through the rafters. <b>Chartwell</b>: Home of Sir Winston Churchill. We took a whirlwind tour through the house and his artist studio. The kitchen garden was fascinating, as was his daughter’s playhouse with the lovely view. Joseph loved the fish pond. Romantic <b>Scotney Castle</b>:  The clerk in the gift shop arched an eyebrow at our whirlwind tour of the gardens. They deserve a thorough examination in the future. Edwards fav.<b>Ightham Mote</b>: Tudor style tiny house surrounded by a mote.  Reminds me of Snow White. One  garden even has a wishing well. <img src="Pictures/bodiam.jpg" align=left><b>Bodiam Castle</b>: we climbed to the top of a turret to enjoy the birds eye view. It's home to a huge tree with “spooky” branches that brushed Joseph's face. It has a mote full of ducks that terrorized Joseph. He was stampeded by them and to this day would rather throw rocks than bread to ducks. <b>Sissinghurst</b>:  My favorite garden, just 30 minutes from Daisha’s house. It wasn’t blooming much but the bare branches let me see how things were pruned and staked and tied. I need to see it in June."

<a class=times15><center>Coastal Rendezvous</center></a>
"Dad and I made our way to the coast for the 43rd anniversary of our engagement," says Diana with a romantic sparkle in her eye. "This year we were in beautiful Bandon, the most spectacular ocean spot on the Oregon coast. We stayed overnight in our small motorhome on a cliff overlooking the ocean and reflected on our 43 years of marriage. It was very romantic. The next day we went to Coquille where we were able to be with Tiana and Hyrum for their baby's blessing, which was wonderful. Hyrum made his famous Bar-b-q and we had so much fun. The following day we all went to Sunset Bay with Dane's family and hiked the bluffs. The grandchildren went down a cliff to a secret bay that you could only get to by making a scary, life-threatening decent with only roots to hold onto as you went. The boys got sunburned and had to stay home from school the first day back." EDITOR'S NOTE: There are two things wrong with this story: 1) Mom paints a very romantic picture of their getaway weekend in the first few sentences, but it's not until the last sentence that we discover that THE BOYS were in tow the entire time! Not sexy. 2) Since when did they have a SMALL motorhome?! Is there a third motorhome of which we are unaware?

<a class=times15><center>The Rain in Spain</center></a><img src="Pictures/holygrail.jpg" align=left>
Daisha, Dakota and Tabitha jetted off with Edward's sister, Eleanor, for a week on the sunny Spanish Costa Blanca. The rain in Spain stayed MAINLY in the plain but did chuck it down for two days on the coast (and on the travelers). They visited Valencia, Alicante, the beautiful hilltop village of Guadalest and stayed in Benidorm (a grotty bit of Northern England transplanted to Eastern Spain - not recommended). They visited castle fortresses, spent a day at a wildlife park (Tabby loved the dolphin show), went to a crazy open air market, played on the beach, visited the holy grail (or at least one of the three worldwide possibilities) at a cathedral in Valencia and ate their fill of local Spanish cuisine (paella, Spanish omelets, fresh Valencian orange juice, churros and thick Spanish hot chocolate - scrummy!).

<b>MARCH:</b><br>Celebrate <i>St. Patrick's Day</i> by watching the geriatric Irish comedy <b> Waking Ned Devine</b>(1998). It's quirky, fun, imaginative and an award winner. A modern classic. <br>

Celebrate <i>Chocolate</i> this Spring with our wildcard movie, <b>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</b>(1971). A cracking good yarn, despite the fact that the Oompa Loompas will give you nightmares! If your kids won't watch anything from the 20th century, try the equally delicious <b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</b> (2005), though the Oompa Loompas are still freakazoids!<br><br>

<a class=times15><center>Necking & Petting Rules!</center></a><img src="Pictures/kiss.jpg" align=left>
"With the first batch of children," begins Diana, "I'd call out, 'don't kiss before marriage!' as they left on their dates. But now I'm changing my tactics a bit. I not only tell Nial no kissing but I also tell him not to activate trouble by hugging or even holding hands. I say that it's married stuff and will activate top-speed hormones that need to be reserved for after the wedding. I also say that as long as hoochy coochy isn't going on, he'll be okay. I guess he is following my advice because the girls can't get enough of the guy that doesn't kiss etc. I know that's how I felt about Dad, he was the only guy that I didn't have to fight off. That made me far more attracted to him than the boys that threw me into a wrestling match on the date."

<a class=times15><center>Danger Zone: FIRE ALERT!!</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/fire.jpg" align=left>
"It was open-burn season," says fire enthusiast, Diana, "so we had a big fire in the field all day. Dusk came and when I opened the back door I saw a horrible, thick cloud of smoke everywhere. Dallas was standing in the smoke and when I asked if the burn fire was out of control, he smiled calmly and said it was nothing. Not believing him, I dashed down the stairs and saw to my horror that a fire was burning in the needles under the big fir tree that towers over our house. I screamed, 'FIRE! Get a hose!' Dallas kept saying it was nothing while Weston threw a pile of needles on the fire to smother it. I kept screaming for them to get the hose but they just laughed at me and said that they had built the fire to get warm and it could be put out easily. Suddenly, the bed of needles began to flare up only a couple of feet from the house! Weston, who had a shovel, attempted to put it out but just ended up shoveling hot coals all over the needles. I ran for the hose. I couldn't believe that two boys who were almost Eagle Scouts and who had handled fire since they were toddlers were about to burn the house down. They just kept laughing, not believing me. I soaked the fire for a half a hour and made the boys shovel all the coals out to bare ground. When everything settled down I went up to the field to check on the other fire. I heard a lot of cracking and popping and turned back toward the house where I saw what looked like a huge, beautiful moonrise, all golden and fantastic, then realized it wasn't the moon but a house fire! I just knew the twins had burned down the house but as I ran back I saw that it wasn't our home but our neighbor's house across the creek. I had Dennis call the fire department. We heard the fire engines driving in circles and getting lost as they tried to find the burning house. The twins sat on top of our roof to watch the fire. After it was all over Dallas came to me and said that this was the best lesson on the best day he could have had for burning down a house. He saw that it only took about ten minutes for the house to be completely engulfed in flames. As it turned out, the fire was a new barn that had been built to house marijuana plants. The hot lights to help them grow had caught fire and the owners had fled to avoid being caught by the police."

"I'm sure Shira will become a famous artist," says proud mother Diana. "We went to Portland and saw the art work that she's been working on at college and were shocked at how good it was. She has always been good at art, but now that she's taken some classes we are sure she will be famous soon or, like many artists, after her death. She is especially outstanding in her drawings. She also has a tough PE class that has whipped her post baby body back into shape. With her tiny body and long hair she looks like a movie queen! She takes good care of her baby on a part-time split with Jeremy, who is a wonderful father to Sophia. Sophia is still an unusual body-mover as she sits and scoots to get herself around. She likes this mode of travel so much that she doesn't seem interested in walking yet. She is extra loving and trusting of people. Her parents have made her so happy with life."

On May 10th Nial received his Eagle Scout award in a Court of Honor at the church in Ashland. "We are proud of him for his efforts," says his father, Dennis. "This is a special time and a crossroads in his life. This achievement was no easy task. It was a long up-hill climb. Often there was time taken to sit down and 'rest', even struggle with the quandary of whether it was worth the effort. But his perseverance has paid off. Nial has learned a lot of valuable skills. He is a great hiker, camper and fly fisherman and loves the outdoors. He will be a better man for his effort here."

Have a fantastic birthday, wedding or special occasion with a picture cake. Here's how to do it:<br>
1. Scan a photo. You could use pictures of ancestors or pictures from the family album.<br>
2. Print the photo on your printer with EDIBLE paper and ink (buy it at computer supply shops).<br><img src="Pictures/cake.jpg" align=right>
3. Place the finished print on top of a flat iced cake and decorate around the edges with a tube of frosting. <br>
4. Add iced or real flowers, toys, candy or decorations for the theme. For example; numbers, sport balls, ballet dancers, tiny babies for a shower or things for a hobby the person has. <br>
*Also, the bakery at your supermarket will often do the whole thing for you if you take a photo to them.<br>

"The twins have taken up sleeping outside with me in their own bed," says masochistic mother, Diana. "Dad only slept out for two nights then ran inside for a warmer bed. He took his star pointer flashlight with him too. I am still getting up at midnight to check out cars that pull up in the parking lot next door. Last night there were several cars. I just don't want drug runners on the lot again - like we have had in the past. I should wear black so they can't see me as well as they can in my light grey sweats. In Mexico the drug sellers kill people who see them."

"Tuesday I bought my seventh cast-iron rose patterned Bistro set and a green garden arch to match," says collector extraordinaire, Diana. "The people at the store asked if I had a restaurant. Everything is now in the living and dining room because it was all getting destroyed outside. We can now seat 29 people at a table in our house, plus we still have the three couches and three love seats and five end tables there too. I like the garden jungle look indoors."

		  Your CLUFFDAQ share price goes up one point for each Tuffcluff News article your team appears in. Given that the bulk of this newspaper is based on family emails and Skype calls, the best way to improve your stock is to write/share interesting information. You can either write an article yourself or hope that someone thinks you're cool enough to write a story about you. So get going, good luck and may the best team win. <br>
