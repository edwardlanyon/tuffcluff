<img src="Pictures/kiss.jpg" align=left>
"Nial went on a date last night," says freaked out mother, Diana, "and I went along in the backseat! I won't let the children date without a chaperone these days. I feel it saves problems. I see now after all the trouble that our family has had, that if we had chaperones then wild, bad, things wouldn't have happened. Nial and his date went out to eat at a Chinese place. I let them go in to eat by themselves but kept an eye on them through the window of the restaurant from the car. They accepted the whole thing well and laughed their way through the date. So everything went okay except that I froze in the car while they ate. Chaperones are needed very bad these days. I think parents will have chaperones in the future, when they wake up to the dangers that their teens are in. I hope I can write a book about chaperones so people will use them again like they did years ago."

"Nial's eyebrows have grown out from the waxing he had done," says relieved mother, Diana. "He almost looked handicapped from the waxing, it was so bad. The eyebrows didn't even look close to a match. They were too short, not close enough to his nose and one brow started almost at the middle of one eye. His bad haircut has grown out too and I have cut a cute style for him. He is looking good now."

Also, I continually seem to be having heart attacks or strokes, so maybe sleeping in sub-zero temperatures isn't so healthy after all."

"The moment the Twins turned 14," says their longsuffering mother, Diana, "I instantly noticed major changes in their hair. Instead of the straight blond hair they've always had, they now have dark blond curly hair. All the boys in our family have turned curly-headed as teenagers. It must be their hormones."

<a class=times15><center>A Bicycle Built <br>For Two</center></a>
"For the Twin's birthday," says creative gift giver, Diana, "they got a tandem bike which they rode to school that day. It was a head turner to see twins riding a tandem. At the middle school a big group of kids gathered around to see their bike. They got a mix of comments; some said it was a cool bike and liked that the twins rode it but others said, 'don't you know that only gays ride tandems?'. Weston said he didn't care what was said, he loved it. He had been asking for a tandem for a couple of years. Dallas said the bike is really fast on hills with two of them peddling but that it is scary to be in the back as the front rider controls every move."

<a class=times15><center>Shira Update</center></a>
Shira has finally decided to get her act together and go back to school. She has signed up for Drawing, Art Theory, Philosophy and two intense and grueling fitness classes that will whip her post-baby body back into shape. She and Jeremy (who is attending school at night) have worked out their schedules so that he can watch their baby by day, and she, by night. Having Sophia has been a blessing for Shira, she feels life is much more colorful with a baby around. And even though it is time consuming and very demanding, Shira rarely gets bored nowadays. Plus, with time going by so fast now, she feels even more compelled to get her education while she still has the time!

<a class=times15><center>Danger Zone: FLOOD ALERT!!</center></a>
"We had masses of rain," reports Diana the disaster magnet, "and the creek flooded worse than ever before. I rose from my sick-bed to get the three heavy benches by the fire-pit up to the lawn and rope the garden furniture to the trees. Of course Dad and the boys were not at home, I had to do all the work by my sick self. The water was so high that it went over the trampoline. When it looked like the creek was about to flood the house, several young men showed up to help us move our valuables to higher ground. They also saved our poor drowning chickens. I wanted to sandbag the house but was told to forget it as we couldn't do it fast enough to save our home. Finally people started yelling at me to leave as the water was all the way up our second porch step. We all left together (people helped drive our cars, vans and motorhomes away) but I suddenly remembered that I hadn't turned off the shop power and went back to do it. Meanwhile, Dad had come from work and was standing there looking at the state of things. I asked if he could divert the flood from our home with his priesthood power. He didn't hesitate. Within 15 minutes the rain stopped and the water receded a foot. Then, when the rain came again a bit later, the county discovered that logs were plugging up the bridge on Dead Indian Road and pulled them loose which made the water go down even more. The Lord works in natural ways, like inspiring men to check the bridges. The creek has settled down now but still looks like a fast flowing river. It's wider now which means that our hot dog area isn't as wide anymore. Oh well, win some, lose some."

<a class=times15><center>Shark Boy</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/greatwhite.jpg" align=left>
Nemo may have lured the name 'Shark Bait', but when it comes to the real gill, Braden may have it hooked! Braden got permission to skip school one Tuesday and went deep sea fishing with his friend Darron and his father. They got all their tack together and set out for their favorite spot in Bandon. Only an hour later they were in the water, lines set and hoping for the best. They waited with no luck for most of the morning and were getting a bit crabby when suddenly Braden got a bite! A wave of excitement curled through him as he quickly grabbed the pole and pulled and reeled but to no avail. Thinking he must have hooked a log and wanting to get free of the debris, he tugged and tugged and tugged! But when the log tugged back, he knew he had a live fish who wanted to be left right where he was. Braden's no guppy, but it was all just too much, so he handed his pole to his friend but even he was floundering, so they passed the pole to his dad who reeled in the beast. There on the end of the line was Braden's first ocean catch; a four foot baby shark! When we asked him why he did it Braden's cool remark was, "Oh, just for the halibut!"

<a class=times15><center>Twins Earn 'Brush With Death' Merit Badge</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/badge.jpg" align=left>
"The twins were all hot to go with on a snow campout with the scouts," says Diana. "They spent $200 on snow pants, a sled, hand warmers, top ramen and candy bars. They were going on a six mile hike to a cabin near Crater Lake. It was snowing heavily and the light was about gone when they set out. The older boys immediately took off, leaving the younger boys (including the twins) and scout leaders behind. They tried to follow the older boys' footprints but the trail split, so three groups of scouts were wandering around in a dark snowstorm. The twin's group eventually lost the trail and began to hike in circles. Hours passed and they were still hiking. They couldn't find the cabin and the snow was now up to their waists. One leader went ahead to try and find the older boys but couldn't see through the blinding snow and got lost. The younger boys found him crawling in the snow and in bad shape. Around midnight, after hours of hiking in bad conditions, they began to feel that they weren't going to make it. Dallas said he about passed out three times. Weston said he didn't know if he was up or down because things were so bad that they couldn't think straight. They had frozen hands, faces and hair, but their new clothes kept their bodies warm. A couple of the boys on the hike only wore sweatshirts! At about 2 am they finally got back to their cars (which were buried under the snow) and were able to pack the half-dead boys inside and take them home to thaw out. They got home around 3 am. When it was light, the scout leaders called Search & Rescue to find the older boys. The rescue team set out on their snowmobiles but had a hard time in the ten and twelve foot mounds of snow. Eventually they found the cabin and dug a trench down to the door. When they opened the door to make the rescue the boys inside were baffled. They hadn't even realized that there was trouble. They admitted that finding the cabin was difficult and that two of them got lost, but never realized how bad it was for the others. It turned out that the twin's group got within a few yards of the cabin but couldn't see it, as it was under a huge snowdrift. Our boys hate snow camping now and never want to experience it again. They were exhausted and dehydrated and would have starved if it weren't for all the candy bars they bought. I wondered why the twins didn't build a snow-cave instead of going another six miles back to the car. The boys said the leaders didn't want to stop, they just kept thinking they could find the cabin or the cars. They had a near-death experience, but were spared. Oh well, win some, lose some."

<a class=times15><center>More Kids For Diana: A Diary</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/tiakids.jpg" align=left>
<b>Thanksgiving</b> We are taking in four Lamanite children for the month of December; two boys and two girls aged from two to nine years. The children are relatives of Hyrum's. He and Tiana have had them for six months but Tiana is four months pregnant now and needs to rest. I asked for the children. I love them and will have fun with them.<br>

<b>A Week Later</b> It is fun having them. There is lots of running for me with the little ones but that's okay, I like the exercise. <br>

<b>Three Days Later</b> The twins have the boys sleep with them in the loft. They play board games, listen to music, laugh and have a daily parties. The twins really have become big brothers fast and have great skills in caring for the little ones. They are great babysitters. At bedtime they read stories to the girls and comfort and discipline them when they need it. They will make great fathers.<br>

<b>The Next Day</b> I see why Tiana needed to have a break. They are like having twins. Every minute is full of action, breakage, destruction, messes and regular children life. One minute their clothes are on and the next they are off with the bathtub water running. It happens so fast.<br>
  
<b>Tiana's View</b> It feels so good to be alone with Tilly and no other kids!!! I have so much more energy! I guess things are going fine with mom and the kids. Sabreena (2) was being nasty to mom when she didn't get her way (kicking, hitting, screaming, etc) and the two girls were like twins going around breaking, spilling, and getting into everything, but when I talked to her last, things were better and seemed to be fine. The first week mom said, "I see why you gave them up." <br>

<b>In The Thick Of It</b> HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!<br>

<b>The End Is Nigh</b> I have pneumonia and am probably going to die. I don't know how much longer I can cope with the children.<br>

<b>Aftermath</b> I feel like I'm floating on air without the four small children to care for. They were fun and good for the boys to care for but lots of work and constant watching. Three days after they left we had the flood. I'm glad I didn't have to watch small children during the disaster.<br>

This year the Lanyons and Beals spent the Christmas Holidays together in the South. The highlight was their visit to Florida where they went to Disneyworld, Cape Canaveral and Seaside then ate their fill of Florida oranges and alligator jerky. Georgia had a lot to offer too with its historic districts, its infantry museum, the local town museum, it's massive library and the virtual reality training pods at the army base. Alabama had little to offer but an exceptionally manky dollar store where numerous white elephants were acquired. To get in the festive mood the two families did Christmassy craft projects, went caroling, ate loads of festive food and visited beautiful Calloway Garden's spectacular 'Fantasy in Lights' display. But for Edward, everything paled in comparison to a trip to the Mexican Buffet! "He was an instant addict," says concerned wife, Daisha. "We must have gone a half a dozen times! And when we got back to England (where Mexican food is rare) he spent weeks experimenting in the kitchen trying to clone the Mexican Buffet's shredded chicken. We were having chicken chimichangas five times a week! It was all getting a bit much, but it's calmed down now, we only have chimichangas twice a week now."

<a class=times15><center>Tiana Ankle Injury (Part 1)</center></a><img src="Pictures/tiaprego.jpg" align=left>
"I fell in the WalMart parking lot yesterday," says Tiana. "Yes, I�m a clumsy pregnant lady. We were putting bags in the back of the van and I headed around to the side doors so I could put Talea in, then I stepped on a dip where the pavement lowered slightly for a manhole. I twisted my ankle and as it happened I heard a pop and I fell to the ground (on my side luckily, and luckily I hadn�t picked up Talea yet). It hurt worse than any twist I�ve had and I couldn�t get up, let anyone touch it. It was really embarrassing because you know how I�m really bad with pain, so I�m lying on the ground trying not to cry (of course that�s not working) and people are trying to help, then Hyrum has the fun job of scooping my massive dead weight off the pavement and carrying me to the other side of the van to put me in (good thing I married a guy with muscle for the herniating job). Talea�s freaking out because she knows something�s wrong with me so I have to suck up the pain and tell her everything�s okay, I just have an owee, so she�s pointing at me and saying ow! The pressure on my ankle was so bad that it felt like I was birthing a baby through my ankle! We get to the ER and wait a couple of hours then they do x-rays and find out that it�s just a really bad sprain, which is great, but also embarrassing that I had to go through all that just for a sprain. They say it could take as long as a break to heal (4-6 weeks), so I�m wearing an air splint, which hurt like the dickens when they put it on! My foot sits crooked and I can�t straighten it because it hurts too badly. I need crutches but I don�t have any so I have to crawl or Hyrum has to drag me around."

<a class=times15><center>Tiana Ankle Injury (Part 2)</center></a>
"I was walking to Hyrum's work," explains pregnant Tiana, "and on my way there I resprained my ankle!! I was wearing tennis shoes and walking on flat ground, so I didn't even have a good reason to sprain it! It was so lame! It hadn't even healed completely, and here it was sprained again. A couple was walking behind me and saw it happen so they ran over to help, but Hyrum's work was in ear shot of me, so I called him and he picked me up to take me home. My ankle looked like it had an egg under it, even worse than the first time, but thankfully I didn't injure it as badly as the first time. Dane says our kids are doomed to have weak ankles because both Hyrum and I have weak ankles that sprain easily."

<a class=times15><center>Karen's Big Shock</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/prego.jpg" align=left>"Not again!! This can't be happening to me!" Karen exclaimed in desperation when she was told her pregnancy test was positive. She does admit to hankering for another baby when she found out that Tiana was pregnant and that her sister, Sherie`, was thinking about having a baby too. But when it came right down to it, she knew this one would be a girl, and a tough one at that, and just could not bring herself to go through it all over again. But Karen got the shock of her life when she went to the doctor for what she thought was a bladder infection and found out that she had a lot more than just a little bladder trouble to worry about! She found herself in floods of tears as the words her doctor had just said replayed over and over in her mind; "You ARE pregnant." She immediately knew it was true. To make matters even worse, Sherie` was not getting pregnant! When Karen told Dane the news over the phone he acted like it was the best thing he had ever heard! Dane has always loved having a baby in the house could not have been happier to learn that another little bundle of joy was on its way. When the ultrasound taken in February showed little boy parts, Karen had another bout of emotions to deal with. Her track record for predicting the sex of each of her babies had always been 100% accurate. She could hardly believe that she could be wrong and this put her into a state of depression. She soon shook it off, however, realizing that boy or girl, she would love it just the same and enjoy this gift from God.

<a class=times15><center>Hormonal Teenage Boys Go To First Dance With Girls</center></a>
"The twins were really excited to go to their first youth dance," says dance enthusiast, Diana. "I pulled out new shirts for them but they gave them the reject and bought really cute new blue shirts on their way to the dance. They took about every tie in the place to match whatever shirts they would buy. I found their best tie dropped outside on the driveway in the rain. I tried to teach them to dance before they left. Dad and I gave them a lesson on  50's rock and roll dancing but the boys stopped us from dancing, saying they would never do a 50's dance these days! So then I ask Nial to teach them how to fast dance and he told them to write their names with their bodies in jiggles and arm movements. I love the way Nial fast dances, he is good, but I never dreamed that all he did was write his name! Then Dad and I tried to teach them slow dances but they were so excited to go they didn't want to watch, they just left. The boys had so much fun at the dance. They danced and talked with lots of girls. Dallas is super aggressive and unafraid like Hyrum so he had the most dances and girls. Weston didn't miss much either, as he danced a lot too. I can't believe they danced when they didn't know how. Dad said he was taught to dance in grade school. Dad was the best dancer I ever danced with. The boys all hit a fast food joint on the way home from the dance, which was big stuff to them as I don't do fast food much. When I went to clean the car later I found six wheat sandwiches filled with turkey meal and dill pickles that I had made weeks ago on the floor under piles of fast-food wrappers and pizza boxes. Kids never change. The first batch used to throw my wheat cereal in the blackberry bushes on the run to the bus stop. Forget it, I'm not going to make lunches for the boys anymore! Anyway, The boys loved their night out and are really excited about going to more dances and meeting girls. Their only problem was sweaty palms. They didn't know why they had them. I tried to explain but they stopped me again!"

<img src="../../Pictures/talea.jpg" align=left>
"Talea has a chore now," says proud parent, Tiana. "She started it at 20 months. She feeds the dogs twice a day! It�s really cute because you ask her if she fed the dogs yet, and she�ll say no, so then you tell her to go feed them and she�ll collect their bowls, take them to the food bin, open the bin, and get the job done. She scoops one scoop into each bowl, but if she gets too much in the scoop, she shakes the excess off before dumping it into the bowl. She has to practically dive inside when the food gets a little low in order to grab the scoop. She�s gotten stuck upside down in there before, so she�s learned that if it�s too far to reach the scoop, she can just climb inside the bin and scoop from there (but then she smells like dog food). After she fills the bowls, she takes them over to their kennel and calls the dogs by saying �Scout!� She knows their names, but Scout is her favorite.  Sometimes she thinks to feed the dogs without anyone reminding her. It�s pretty nice to have that one chore taken off my shoulders."

<a class=times15><center>Food Storage Tips</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/tip.jpg" align=left>
Ten years ago I wrote a survival manual called "Keeping Up With The Times". The following are some top tips from the manual: 
<li><b>Car Food Storage</b> Keep a backpack in the trunk of your car filled with food (crackers, dried fruit, a few cans of tuna with a can opener, etc), water, a sleeping bag for warmth, a good book for long waits and containers and tissue for human waste. I learned this when living in LA with long waits on the freeways and in our mountain freeways in Oregon when stormy weather causes disruption now and then. If you are prepared you won't have to seek food, warmth and a bathroom and can stay in your car. ALWAYS stay in your car in a bad snow storm because it is the only way to be found. Most travelers leave their cars and then run out of food and warmth.<br> 

<li><b>Winter Food Storage</b> I always buy about four 10 lb bags of potatoes and have a big 25 lb sack of beans on hand for the winter. I buy big bags of flour for lots of bead and scones, or keep a wheat grinder to grind by hand. I store 50 lbs of oatmeal in the chest freezer or dry pack it. I keep a tomato plant growing inside by a south facing window and pollinate it with a tiny paint brush (see my new, fast <a href="../../house/recipes/soupsalad/tomsalad.html">tomato salad</a> recipe). I keep a quart jar with a screen on top in the kitchen window with wheat sprouts for salads. Try deer this time of year. Make lots of jerky over a campfire. I know how to smoke it, if anyone wants to know. Or buy meat on sale and deep freeze it. I buy 4 or 5 extra turkeys at Thanksgiving and stick them in freezer for later. It is good to keep some extra food at home with grocery stores being the main source of food and natural disasters increasing everywhere these days. Don't be caught without food or water when the stores are empty. Fill all empty jars and jugs with water and add a capful of bleach to keep the water safe for later use.<br> 

<li><b>Fresh Summer Food</b> I plant pots outside the house for broccoli, chard, tomatoes, brussel sprouts, strawberries, rhubarb, green onions, yellow onions and radishes. I keep a gallon of homemade yogurt going every week to make fresh blackberry, banana and rhubarb yogurt smoothies. Cattails are edible if you have to resort to wild food. The roots are good, like potatoes, and the young tails are like corn. You can find a lot of salad material in your own backyard. Get to know wild foods. I still want a goat for meat, cheese, butter, cottage cheese and milk, but don't have one at this point in time.

"Sophia is quite a character," says baffled mother, Shira. "Take, for instance, the way she gets around. She has created a new form of crawling, referred to, by some people, as 'scooting'. She simply scoots on her bottom (using her legs as oars, so to speak) to get from here to there, replacing crawling, the most common technique of baby mobility. Everyone is most fascinated by her. The other day waiting in the Portland airport, she scooted herself around, greeting all the people that were waiting for their flight. She then proceeded to scoot right up to a group of strangers that found her particularly funny, and nabbed a sandwich right out of the hand of some girl, with absolutely no remorse! Talk about spunk! Sophia has no interest in crawling at all. We all have yet to see her attempt it. Grandma says she scoots 'to keep her hands and pretty dresses clean and lady-like'. Well, whatever the reason, we are all baffled, but delightfully surprised at the talented little gal."
