"Nial's hair was hacked off by a 'professional' in class as part of the lesson," reports Nial's horrified mother, Diana, "and his bangs are way too short for his [unusually] HUGE eyebrows. A group of girls at his school must have noticed because a few days later they took Nial to a beauty parlor and had his eyebrows waxed! The people at the beauty parlor obviously hadn't dealt with many men [with such massive eyebrows] before because his eyebrows came out all uneven, way too thin and weren't even the same size! They looked terrible! I wish people would leave my children's hair and eyebrows alone. I don't want funny eyebrows coming home. Now he'll have to look like a Halloween freak for weeks until everything grows out."

On November 30th Dakota was summoned to a court in Rochester, England to appear before three magistrates who officially changed his surname to Lanyon in a long-awaited adoption order. It was a memorable day for both Dakota and his family who celebrated his new status with a day out in London and a meal at his favorite restaurant.

<a class=times15><center>Over-Fished</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/fish.jpg" align=left>
"Our Twins are begging to go fly-fishing again," says weary mom, Diana. "They can never get enough of fishing. And since Dad's the only one who will eat what they catch, we have a whole chest freezer filled with fish and no where else to put it!"
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Cage Rocks</center></a>
Cage, who is in the 6th grade, has started taking bass lessons and is by all accounts pretty good. "I let Cage choose her music," says her mother Natasha. "She'll like the lessons more if she's playing music she chooses. So far she's mastered 'Highway to Hell'. She is learning scales and stuff too and she really likes playing a portable instrument."

<a class=times15><center>Nat v. The Law</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/scales.jpg" align=left>
"I have been busy with a new temp job," reports Natasha, "at the San Diego county public law library organizing their largest annual fundraiser. Mostly it's all arranging catering, venue, program/ads, donations, guest list stuff and all that. My contract is finished on Thanksgiving and then I'm planning on doing the LSAT on Dec 3rd so I can start law school next Autumn...we'll see if my entrance scores are good enough."

<a class=times15><center>Hot Halloween</center></a>
"Halloween is here and I'm a wicked witch this year," says San Diego resident, Natasha. "Cage is Goth, Dru is a peacock and Steve is Sumo Wrestler Elvis like he was last year. He likes Christmas more, but I force him to dress up anyway. It's lame when parents don't participate. We can't wait to trick-or-treat; we usually get quite a haul and there are some insanely decorated houses in our neighborhood!" 
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Football v. Soccer</center></a>	
"The boys lost their football game again last night," reports the Twin's father, Dennis. "It seems to me that a lot of the good players have switched to soccer (Ashland Middle School's soccer team is number one) which goes on at the same time. We have a lot of tough players but not a lot of fast ones. The larger schools have twice as many boys on their teams but still manage to have soccer teams too." 
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Blessed Are <br>The Children</center></a>
"The twins recently had their Patriarchal Blessings," reports their father, Dennis, "and it was truly a memorable experience." The twin's mother, Diana, agrees. "After hearing what is in store for them," she says "I'm going to treat them with much more patience and respect."

<img src="Pictures/hyultras.jpg" align=left>
"I had my 19 week ultrasound," says expectant mother Tiana, "and we�re having a boy!! You should have heard the ultrasound tech. He�s been doing ultrasounds for 23 years, but when he finally got a crotch shot and the �goods� were obvious, he was shocked by the size of his �male anatomy�. We�ll see when he�s born, but it looks like he won�t be the one to get teased in the locker room. Hyrum jokes that it must come from my side. I had a feeling it would be a boy because I wanted it to be a girl. I wanted Talea to be a boy, and I got the opposite. At least I�ll have one of each (boy and girl), so I�m pretty happy. We don't know what we'll name him yet. The tech kept calling him 'Floyd' after the barber on the Andy Griffith show, but that�s out of the question. We�re not doing 'Hy 5' (Hyrum the 5th) either."

<a class=times15><center>Bone Crusher</center></a>
"We've had 42 years of marriage, 10 children and seven trampolines but it has never happened to us," says an astonished Diana. "We've had more than six car crashes, one airplane crash and dozens of bad falls (off trees, roofs, stairs, ladders etc) but not one of our children had ever broken a bone - until now. Weston fell backwards while playing dodgeball and snapped his wrist as he tried to catch himself. He handled it great. He takes pain really good. He always has. Half his finger was cut off when he was 18 months and had to be sewed back on, but he hardly even cried. I taught him how to 'blow out' when he'd feel terrible pain and told him how the Indians didn't even blink or moan when they had their bones set. Weston's break was clean enough that I think I could have handled it myself if I'd wrapped it somewhat tight and put protection around it, but since it was our first break I didn't risk it this time. All is well now and Weston will have his cast off in a month or so."

<a class=times15><center>Halloween in Ashland</center></a>
<img src="../../peoplepages/dane/Pictures/danpmkn.jpg" align=left>
"The best Halloween costume I saw downtown this year," says Diana, "was a man dressed as a vampire holding a cardboard sign that said: 'Will Work for Blood - God Bless.' The twins had fun downtown at the parade then went out trick-or-treating and got lots of candy. I took tithing from their candy for Christmas, much to their complaining. Nial hung out downtown with his gang of girls. He was dressed as a Ninja Turtle with three others (you should see him in green tights). Shira said she watched The Legend of Sleepy Hollow for her fun night with her family. Dad and I watched spooky movies at home. We don't get many trick-or-treaters anymore, I don't know why. They all stopped coming the year after I handed out baggies full of my <a href="../../features/recipes/breakfast/granola.html">homemade granola</a> instead of candy. Win some, lose some. Oh, I forgot to tell you about Halloween morning. I woke up really early and put on my boogieman mask (a troll with a huge warty nose and hairy chin) then I added a second Dracula mask with horns. Next I put trick-or-treater safety flasher lights all over my sweatshirt then grabbed my haunted house table centerpiece that makes a spooky "woooo, wooooooooo" noise and went to wake up Dad with a spooky kiss. After that I ran to the boys room and did the same thing. It was still a bit dark so the flasher lights got their attention! I put on the screaming Halloween tape and served a thriller breakfast on Halloween dishes in candlelight with my mask still on. It's hard to see with a mask on - you do a lot of bumping and fumbling in the kitchen. I hope you all dressed up in something fun, made lots of fun treats for your families and used dry ice in your punch. Laugh it up."

<a class=times15><center>Nial File</center></a>
<b>Job:</b> "Nial has started his own business and is making $20-$30 an hour," says proud mother Diana. "He is a clean up man at construction sites. It is hard work but he's good at it and receives daily compliments on his fine work. He fixed up the beast (old Ford van) and uses our trailer to do the work. He has to buy a permit for each town he works in. He works a full day and has to go to the dump several times. He comes home really sore everyday. Working for pay has really made a man out of him. It's a good way for teenagers to use energy." The only problems is that after permits, gas ($25+ a day), taxes and dump fees, Nial only ends up making about $0.17 a day!
<br> 
<b>Talents:</b>"Nial can sew!" says shocked mother, Diana. "I just about dropped dead when he come home from school in his quiet manner and showed me the things that he made in his sewing class. I jumped for joy and hugged him. My first boy to sew! He made a pillowcase that's in a blue Hawaiian print with rows of black fish and the repeating words 'Vicious Fishes' all over. He also made PJ bottoms that look like they are from the store! He even matched all the patterns at the seams. Not only can he sew, he can knit too! He is knitting a hat right now." 
<br>
<b>Social Life:</b>"The girls are mad for Nial," says baffled mother, Diana. "They want him to play with them everyday. No thanks! Girls call him all the time. Some show up at the house, without warning, to take him out. A couple of weeks ago he was kidnapped by two girls in the school library. He came home about 8 pm and I was worried and calling all over to find out where he was. He had been taken to the park, to the movies and out to dinner by the girls. Now, Nial is always coming home late with the 'kidnapping' excuse. I can't believe how many girls fall over him. Last weekend he had girls fighting over him for their date. He is constantly tormented by them! I can't keep track of them. He must have seven to ten girls that hang out with him and want to take him out! I will have to have him bring them all over for a hot dog roast so he won't be a freeloader and live off women."

<a class=times15><center>Top DVD Picks</a></center>
<b>For Kids:</b> If you haven't checked out <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> yet, you've gotta see it. As toddlers, Dallas and Weston watched it so many times that that their mother began to suspect it contained addictive subliminal messages to get kids hooked on TV! True story. <br>  
<b>For Family:</b> An oldie but goodie, <i>Meet Me in Saint Louis</i> is perfect to watch at this time of year since it has fabulous Halloween and Christmas scenes.<br>
<b>For Parents:</b> The addictive real-time Fox network thriller, <i>24</i>, is a rare thing - a decent TV drama. Thank heavens for the invention of the DVD because it would be tortuous to be left hanging for a week between each episode (let alone during the commercial breaks)! Rent the first four series and have a 96-hour white-knuckle marathon.

Summer's over and the sun is setting earlier which means cold, dark days ahead. This Fall, snuggle up on the couch with your family and a warm mug of cocoa to watch our top Autumn movie picks - you know you want to!<br>
<b>SEPTEMBER:</b><br>
We all love <b>What's Up Doc</b> (1972) with Barbra Streisand, but did you know that it was based on the equally hilarious <b>Bringing Up Baby</b> (1938) with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn Swap the overnight cases with a leopard and play spot-the-similarities. If you haven't seen these films you won't be disappointed - they're the best screwball comedies ever made! Even the kids will love 'em (despite the latter being B&W). Check them both out for a fun, family double-feature in September.<br>
<b>OCTOBER:</b><br>
Carry on with the Cary Grant theme by watching <b>Arsenic and Old Lace</b> (1944). If you haven't seen this hilarious Halloween movie, there is no better time than this month. Originally a Broadway play, it was turned into an excellent movie by director Frank Capra (the same guy who did It's a Wonderful Life). Guaranteed to make you giggle (if only at Cary Grant's hyperactive shenanigans).<br>
<b>NOVEMBER:</b><br>
I know you won't like this suggestion but you really should watch <b>The Emigrant Saga</b> (1971) this month. It's traditional and, as shocking as it sounds, the movie isn't actually all that bad (nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture). This movie has everything; explosions (albeit a little girl's stomach), scandal (a prostitute with lice), horror (Karl-Oskar's relentless advances toward his poor ever-pregnant wife) and so much more! Come on, you know you wanna see it. However, you should know that it's true title is 'Utvandrarna' which translates into 'The Emigrants' (in case you're trying to find a hard-to-get-hold-of copy). Give it a real chance and who knows, you may end up loving it so much that you'll rent the sequel, 'The New Land'. <br>
<b>WILD CARD:</b><br>
This season our wild card movie is a guilty pleasure <b>The Scarlet Pimpernel</b> (1982). It may not be the most worthy version of this film, in fact it's just a lowly TV movie, but it was still nominated for three Academy Awards and won an Emmy (though it was only for costumes). The biggest thing about this movie is Jane Seymour's hair (which even puts Diana's 80's hair to shame) but there's much more than big hair to keep the whole family entertained. Anthony Andrews gives a 'dandy' performance that is truly delightful. Sink me if this isn't the best 1980's TV movie ever!

<img src="Pictures/chicken.jpg" align=left>
"This week Mildred passed on due to mysterious reasons," reports Diana. "It may have been the bird flu or maybe the grey fox that chases me on my walks up Dead Indian Road. It was molting season and she was lacking feathers, so maybe she froze to death on a cold night. Anyway the twins found her in a dead position in the coop. Dallas was in charge of digging a hole by a sick plant in the yard to put her in. There was no crying from the other chickens at her loss, so all is well now in the coop."

<img src="Pictures/mouse.jpg" align=left>
"We have a mouse in the house," reports Diana. "It probably came in through the sliding glass door, which I leave open at night to cool the house. The screen is history now as we kept walking into it and it was warped beyond repair. We discovered the mouse as our family was reading scriptures. Suddenly, he popped out from under a couch. Dallas yelled "MOUSE!" All three boys immediately jumped towards where Dallas was pointing. I was startled at how fast their reaction was. I have never seen any of them move so fast. I wish they would do that when I tell them to do their work. The boys were hunting around like cats; over-turning furniture and pouncing all over the room while I was frozen on the couch with my feet up. Dallas, who was running in a serpentine, scored when he smashed the mouse with the shoe he had in his hand. He threw its body outside - it landed in my birdbath. A week later we were reading scripture again and another mouse appeared from under the couch. The boys went into the hunting mode again. After running all over and lifting up couches, they got a big stick. When that didn't work, Nial saw the cat outside, grabbed him and tried to get him to get the mouse. The cat, being a outside cat, almost tore Nial apart trying to get back outside. Then Dallas yelled, "DART GUN!" Weston ran out to the barn and got the gun. Weston scored when he aimed and shot the mouse through the stomach with a dart. The boys fed the mouse to our grateful cat. Thanks to Hyrum and Tiana for buying the boys dart guns. It's good to have sons that are hunters. I hope they can get a deer this year, as I have learned from a Western movie how to smoke deer meat in strips over a campfire. Our boys love jerky as much as candy so that could be their Halloween treat (along with top ramen and tapioca pudding).

<a class=times15><center>Classic Twin Prank Becomes Tiresome</center></a>
For 'Twin Day' at Middle School Dallas and Weston once again pulled their classic prank and switched places (see previous articles <a href="newsspr04.html">"Twin Day"</a> and <a href="newsfal04.html">"It's Twin Day! - Again?!"</a>). "They said people didn't figure it out for a long time," says proud mother, Diana. "But now that they've done it more than once, it was old, so they just returned to their classes when they were discovered. Out of the five sets of twins in the school, they are the only look-a-likes."

<a class=times15><center>Game Over</center></a>
"Those video games are the only party kids like these days," says disgruntled party planner, Diana. "It's the only thing my boys want when kids come over. I try 'Great Wrestlers of America', taffy pulls, kick the can etc. but they only play my games if I insist, and always go back to the video games when I am not looking."

<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Tip # 1: Internet Shaming Tactics</center></a>
"To help prevent kids from looking at naughty internet sites, tell them that if guilty they will have to stand stripped of clothes in front of the family like the pictures on the net they like looking at so much. This is a pretty scary thought to all the family and should prevent them from doing anything they shouldn't." 
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Tip # 2: Clogged Drains</center></a>
"My home remedy for clogged drains: Pour a bunch of <b>salt</b> down the nasty drain, then lots of <b>soda</b> and finally lots of <b>vinegar</b> (I used a gallon of white vinegar and a box each of salt and soda).  It looks and sounds like Halloween dry ice bubbling up from the drain. Let it sit two days and keep adding more of the mixture as it starts to slowly drain away. Next, pour four gallons of <b>boiling water</b> into the drain. Then pour my drain mixture down all the drains in the house to help the clogged one and in the morning, the drain is completely clear! For prevention, pour the salt/soda/vinegar mixture down each drain monthly to get trapped food and hair. I have heard pouring boiling water down drains weekly will prevents clogs too."
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Tip # 3: Potty Training</center></a>
"I made up a potty training song that I used for my children ('Indian boy, Indian boy, potty in the bushes') as they ran around diaperless in the backyard. Sounds weird, but it makes potty training fast. It only works if you live out of town, however, and backfires when you visit other peoples homes."
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Tip # 4: Diet Helper</center></a>
"Eat small, be small - that's what I always say," says diet guru Diana. "The twins have been following my advice for 6 weeks and Dallas has lost 11 pounds and Weston 10. I started serving a light supper at night instead of a big dinner. We now have simple food like bread and milk with cottage cheese and onions. Other times we have fruit, soup or foods that won't rake up the pounds. I also dip out the portions and hide the rest of the food so that second helpings won't be around for temptation later. The middle school won't allow seconds this year either. Our biggest meal of the day is at lunchtime each day no matter what. This is what Grandmother Annie Hassell always did and no one in the family ever gained weight all their lives. So remember: eat big, be big; eat small, be small."

<a class=times15><center>What's in a Name?</center></a>
"Dennis and I wanted all our children's name to start with D's," reveals Diana, "but we couldn't find enough "D" names that we liked [they ran short of inspiration quickly and ended up naming their firstborn Barten]. Dane says he loves his name and Daisha seems to love hers too (even though the English think it's weird). We gave Melanie a D name for her middle name but are glad we named her after Melanie in Gone With the Wind because she likes that. It's funny that she ended up in the South close to Atlanta and acts a lot like Melanie from the movie. Tiana loves her name, which means Diana in Hawaiian. Natasha loves hers but hates Heather, which is her actual first name. Shira loves her name which is Hebrew for song. Funny, Shira loves to sing so much. I never liked the name Nial, but it was Dennis's turn to do the naming. I wanted Britten, Nial's middle name, because I wanted to call him Britt. It's funny though that Nial almost lives at the river and is an outstanding fisherman. Dallas and Weston were two Western sounding names that just seemed to go together, which was good for twins."   
<hr>	
<a class=times15><center>Back Up vs. Make Up</center></a>
"I don't back things up well," Diana confesses. "Backing up the boat trailer is my worst nightmare. Girls weren't made to back up things, just like boys weren't made to put on make-up."

		  Your CLUFFDAQ share price depends upon how many TuffCluff News articles your team members appear in. Given that the bulk of this newspaper is based on family emails and skype calls, the best way to improve your stock is to share info. So get emailing, good luck and may the best team win. <br><b>(1 point per each article in which your team appears, 1 point for sending something in, 5 points taken away if your team doesn't appear in any!)</b>
