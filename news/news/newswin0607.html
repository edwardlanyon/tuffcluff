<a class=times15><center>A Touching Tale of a Traditional Old Fashioned Cluff Family Christmas</center></a>
</center><img src="Pictures/vomfest.jpg" align=left>
'Twas to be the first time 'ere seven long years that the family o' Cluff would congregate as one, in their entirety - one score, three and ten in number - together for a great gathering of yuletide festivities. 'Twas but a week afore Christmas and, great preparations made, the Cluffs awaited the arrival of the masses at the Cluff Estate. The house was in order (relatively speaking); the abode was adorned in happy decoration, the beds bestowed with the freshest of sheets, the fire well-stoked and the pleasing odours of cinnamon and spice wafted most seductively betwixt rooms. Whereupon the masses did begin to be received and, with accursed haste, all was rent asunder as a vile vomiting plague was visited upon those gathered. Alas, six and ten of the people were rendered infirm and hitherto confined to convalesce. Ne'er so many children discharged the contents of their stomachs during the course of the family photograph, 'twas necessary to cease photography and with all regret retire from the field. "Isn't it traditional to have an ADVENTURE whenever we start something?" spake fair Dennis. Further diseases struck at the very bosom of this noble family as, towards the finish, the croup, flu, fever, infections of the ear and the threat of consumption were to wreak their merry havoc amongst the Cluffs. One child was ailing to such great excess that he had to be conveyed forthwith unto the infirmary. But anon, one and all were joyous when reflecting upon the holiday's true meaning because after all, Christmas ‘tis 'bout sharing!

A crazed dog wandered onto the high school campus and suddenly attacked Weston while he was walking by. It bit his arm, ripping his shirt and breaking the skin. He went to the nurse's office where the alert was raised and the police were called. The police spent days searching for the poor dog fearing  that it might have caught a nasty disease from Weston. When they finally found it the tests came back negative.

Anarchy abounds in the Cluff chicken coop - it's every hen for herself now! It all started with the death of one of the oldest chickens in the coop. She died in a cold-snap which sparked off a spate of violent protests over inadequate conditions. But instead of things getting better, the violence led to the eventual deaths of two more hens. One particularly bad example of the carnage was the ritualistic murder of a small, defenseless Bantam - gangster style. The poor Bantam was pecked to within an inch of her life and then, in a shocking and devilish frenzy, EATEN ALIVE by the other members of the coop! When it was all over, only her legs remained! After that the coop went quiet. It remains to be seen what happens next.

<a class=times15><center>Cluffmas Reunion 2006: <br> Original Plans vs. What Actually Happened</center></a><img src="Pictures/xmastr.jpg" align=left><img src="Pictures/xmastre.jpg" align=right>This year Cluffs the world over gathered for a very special holiday reunion - then ran away screaming in horror! It was the first time in seven years that all 33 Cluffs would be together in one place. Diana was determined that it would be memorable. For months she worked on a game-plan with a range of activities and events to suit anyone and everyone. Unfortunately the only thing that ended up going to plan was the "memorable" bit - but not for the reasons she had originally intended! <br>

<b>ACTIVITIES</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Make gingerbread houses, popcorn balls and fudge, have a taffy pull, watch Christmas movies, play games, dance, do the Family Yell, Great Wrestlers of America, watch home movies, act out The Christmas Story with costumes etc..." <i>What Actually Happened:</i> Everyone vomited.<br>

<b>DANCING</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Cotton Eye Joe Dance, Chicken Dance, Jeremy teach the boys to breakdance, Israeli Dance, Pig Dance, Irish Dance, women do Dance of the Veils to wild Middle-Eastern music, Limbo, Mexican shakers with costumes to music and Teen Dance. Music can be fast, Beach Boys, 50’S, Hooked on Classics, Lord of the Dance, etc..." <i>What Actually Happened:</i> Too sick to move. Everyone threw up instead.<br>

<b>TALENTS</b> 
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Dane’s Family Band, Air Band (adult men as famous rock singers jumping and sliding on knees with microphone, guitars etc), play Indian drums, comedians with microphone and a set of clean jokes and Bad Hair Day (youth with wild hair)" <i>What Actually Happened:</i> Everyone tossed their cookies.<br>

<b>SNOW PARTY</b> 
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Go play at the snow with big thermoses of homemade chili and hot chocolate."<br>
<i>What Actually Happened:</i> Only the kids had enough energy to go skiing. The rest stayed home and blew chunks.<br>

<b>FAMILY PICTURES</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> "We looked good in our TuffCluff picture as cowboys, so a theme for one of  
the family pictures might be good again. What about dressing like Cavemen or Middle Eastern  
people? Take pictures outdoors with green as background" <i>What Actually Happened:</i> It was raining like cats and dogs so everyone had to run for cover in the nasty barn. Everyone's hair was ruined and several children were actively vomiting during the photo shoot. Costumes were vetoed since it was hard enough to find something to wear that hadn't been vomited on. So many people were sick during the shoot that it had to be cut short and we never did end up getting a picture with every head visible.<br>

<b>CATCH UP WITH RELATIVES</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Invite Grandparents and relatives to a big dance and party."<br>
<i>What Actually Happened:</i> No one dared enter the "quarantine" house.<br>

<b>FOOD</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> "Dad’s biscuits and gravy, hot dog roast, autumn stew, lentils or  
split peas with carrots, potato soup, beans on toast (the English way), homemade bread, filled baked potatoes, tapioca pudding, sub-sandwiches, yogurt shakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, sherbet milkshakes, coleslaw, potato salad, fudgesicle, scones, fried rice, steam vegetables, Spanish rice, beans, tacos, burritos, chips, spaghetti, garlic bread, green salad, ham, turkey, dressing, cranberries, yams, fruit salad, rolls, green beans, olives, deep-dish apple pie and ice cream." <i>What Actually Happened:</i> Nobody could hold anything down. There was Pacific Lime Mold everywhere!<br>

<b>CHRISTMAS DAY</b>
<i>Original Plans:</i> Santa visits children with his sack to deliver gifts, exchange white elephants wrapped in tin foil, Christmas dinner and family holds hands around Christmas tree and sings festive songs.<br>
<i>What Actually Happened:</i> Everyone barfed.<br>

<a class=times15><center>Down White Weighty</center></a>
An unusually heavy snowstorm left behind nearly a foot of wet snow late February to the amazement of Ashland locals. After brushing off a dusting of snow, outdoor winter sleeping veteran Diana nestled in for the night. Inch by inch snow began to pile up. "I got to wondering whether I would be buried alive and not be able to move like in an avalanche and my feet were really cold but I was ok," reported Diana.  The sound of trees coming down in the yard finally drove her inside for refuge. The boys moved the motorhomes to get them away from falling limbs. Daylight revealed at least three trees down including the big plum tree in front of the house along with many limbs. It may be known as the deepest snowstorm ever! Grandma Anna said, “I remember that we used to get a lot more snow in Ashland when I was raising my family. We sledded down Clay Street and had a good time. It's been a long time since we've had that kind of snowfall and I don't remember ever having as much as we are getting now!”

"Imagine driving with three kids for 52 hours straight," says Melanie with a weary sigh. "We did it and you can too! Come visit us. We’ll show you some Southern hospitality." Here's a quick rundown of what happened on the Beal's epic journey: <b>Getting There…</b> The Beal family load up the van in mid-December with the slogan “Oregon or Bust”.  
Climbing out of the South we see Tupelo where "The King" was born. Snow falling, a delight for us Southern folk. Kira throws up, only once. Hot chocolate spills on three out of five of us. Potty breaks every 100 miles or there will be busting. Grumpy parents. Eating McDonalds in a train box car. One big, bad diaper. Gas at $2.69 a gallon, seems expensive. Oklahoma’s flat barren wastelands, with a spectacular sunset. A glimpse of route 66. Church in Albuquerque where Joseph plays a smuggled harmonica during sacrament meeting. <b>And Back Again…</b> Major snowstorm closes I40 (only one tiny snowplow in sight) through New Mexico. Detour through Texas. Discover it really is “Giant”.

<a class=times15><center>Lanyons Leave Their Lunch in San Francisco</center></a>
The Lanyons flew out for the Cluffmas party a few days early so they could have a family minibreak in San Francisco. They awoke at four in the morning (time-zone trouble) raring to go and loitered around Fishman's Wharf for hours before the first shop keepers began to arrive. They did all the touristy things; toured Alcatraz, took the cable cars, visited Union Square, laughed at Nob Hill (nob means something very different in England), drove down Lombard Street and ate clam chowder in bread bowls. As time to depart grew closer they were sad and began to understand the whole leaving-your-heart-in-San Francisco thing but San Francisco didn't let them go without a fun, little parting gift - the raging stomach bug that would later ruin Cluffmas!

Winter is a time for the family to gather close together, to share old memories and make new ones. Cuddle up on the couch with your family this season and share some of your favorite, childhood movie moments. Then recoil in horror as they dis 'It's A Wonderful Life' just because it's black and white. Kids these days!  <br>
<br>
<b>DECEMBER:</b><br>
Have a retro Christmas with the kids this year by watching all the old, nostalgic stuff they used to show on TV every year:<br>
<img src="Pictures/xmastr.jpg" align=left><b>Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas</b> (1966),<b> A Charlie Brown Christmas</b> (1965), <b>Frosty the Snowman</b> (1969),<b> Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer</b> (1964), <b>Mickey's Christmas Carol </b>(1984), <b>Mr. Krueger's Christmas </b>(1980), <b>The Gift of Love: A Christmas Story </b>(1983), <b>The Muppet Christmas Carol </b>(1992), etc...<br>
<br>
<b>JANUARY:</b><br>
It's January. You're feeling fat from the Christmas excesses, you're feeling depressed because you've already broken your New Years resolutions and you're feeling cold because it's the dead of winter. You think you have it bad? Spare a thought for the poor Cheyenne Indians in <b>Windwalker</b> (1980) who were sometimes so hungry that they would even eat meat that was pre-chewed by a six year old, who's minor problems included being killed/kidnapped by the Crow every time the left the teepee and who had to kill a bear and make a coat if they wanted to get warm in the snow. Force your family to appreciate how great they've got it by making them watch this film. We had to!
<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY:</b><br> <img src="Pictures/conheart.jpg" align=left>
For Valentines Day this year check out the rom-com that has it all; Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles... It's <b>The Princess Bride</b> (1987) of course! Who could resist the charms of this nearly-perfect chick flick?
<br>
<br>
<b>WILDCARD:</b><br>This winter our wildcard is movie is <b>Ma and Pa Kettle</b> (1949). It's a bit hit and miss but still fun to re-watch if only to remember the fits of laughter Mom and Dad used to get into as they watched. <br>

<a class=times15><center>15 Years of Child Neglect: Weston's Tragic Tale</center></a><img src="../../Pictures/weston.jpg" align=left>
In a shocking blow, Weston has just discovered that he is not actually the person he thought he was. After 15 years of living a lie he accidentally stumbled upon an earth shattering secret that had been kept from him since birth; that his name is not Weston but actually WesTEN! "I completely forgot until we looked at his birth certificate," begins Weston/en's elderly mother, Diana, "that I had actually decided to spell his name with an "en" instead of an "on" because he was my tenth child and I wanted his name to say that." Weston/en was understandable distraught when he discovered the truth and was even the subject of intense sympathy at school for a few weeks where he was dubbed a poor, neglected child. Not one to wallow in self-pity, Weston/en has picked himself up from this tragedy and moved on, albeit with a new, rebellious spirit - he has refused to spell his name with an "e", despite it being "illegal" to do otherwise. Let's just hope that case sensitive agencies such as the DMV appreciate the complexities behind his name being one letter off. Somehow I doubt it!

<a class=times15><center>Got Your Goat</center></a><img src="Pictures/goat2.jpg" align=left>
The Cluffs have had their fair share of goats. There was 'Wigglesword' the earless neurotic, Hansel & Gretel the playful pygmies, Porthos, Athos and Aramis the three pygmateers and a Nubian mother and three kids which no one can remember the names of because there have been so many! This February, yet another goat came into the Cluff's life. It all started when Diana got a call from a neighbor complaining that the Cluff's goat was running amuck in their yard. Diana was perplexed, they hadn't owned a goat in years. When another neighbor called to say they heard the Cluff's goat was up on the runway at the airport and the police were involved, Diana got curious. The police were having a lot of trouble catching the goat so she volunteered the twins to help. The boys jumped at the chance and were climbing through blackberry bushes and jumping into the partially frozen creek in wild pursuit of the pesky goat. Eventually they cornered the wily beast and won the admiration of the weary policemen. After the goat was secured the police confessed that they didn't know what to do with it. Diana swiftly jumped at the chance for a free lawnmower. She suggested tethering it near the road in front of their house so that it would be visible to anyone driving by looking for it. If no one claimed it, she would keep it. They police handed it over. The Cluffs built a shelter and gave it food but within hours the goat had escaped again. The police were called out again, and again enlisted the twins help in recapturing the cunning creature. This time when it was caught the Cluffs bought a special collar and chain to keep it firmly in place. But within hours the goat had broken free and was on the move again. The police came out again and called the twins again. This went on and on. The goat was found up at Ashland Hills Inn, by the A & W, near the freeway, next to the church and so on until finally the police refused to deal with the goat anymore. They said they had better things to do in Ashland than catch goats. We all know THAT is a lie. The goat kept this up until eventually its wild spree was ended when it broke its leg. It spent some time convalescing in the Tobiasson's field where it was spotted by its owner. A week later Dennis was attending a local meeting when he overheard a big group discussing the wild exploits of the legendary goat that evaded capture. Dennis stepped in to give a first hand account of the events and became the man of the hour. The whole experience has reaffirmed what Dennis has always felt about goats. "I was through with goats 15 years ago when Wigglesword escaped and ate all the bark off our fruit trees. I’ll never have a goat again!" But Diana hasn't been put off the idea of having a goat at all, "I like how useful they are," she says. "You have a lawnmower, milk and meat all in one animal. I’d like to have a whole herd" Let’s just hope the local police don’t get wind of Diana’s plan! <hr>

<a class=times15><center>Speedy Reader</center></a><img src="Pictures/bible.jpg" align=left>
In a fantastic feat, Diana reports that she got through Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts, Revelations, The Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants and The Pearl of Great Price - all in just 11 days! Here she reveals the two secrets she used to achieve such success. <b>1) Multi-Tasking:</b> She listened to CDs while she did her chores then read when she had breaks. <b>2) Zig-Zag Reading:</b> Amazingly, she has taught herself to speed read by zig-zagging down a page so that it takes only a faction of the amount of time it would normally. Armed with only these two secret weapons she's confident that she is scriptural top dog and challenges anyone to try to beat her. "Reading scriptures is more than a hobby for me," she says. "It makes me so happy that I feel like I just got a nice present or went on a really good vacation or had a nice, clean shower."
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Cure For Grouchy Kids</center></a>
"When anyone, especially teenagers, are mean to their mother," begins Diana, "something is up in the sin department. The best way to deal with it is to coach the child back on track so they can be normal and happy again. When we live truth we are happy as true things like kindness, manners and honesty always work. Living truth always puts you on the winning team. Check out history and see that those who lived in peace, faith, love and service always prospered. The other way - self indulgence, pride, slavery, lust, etc. - only brings destruction."

<img src="Pictures/eagle.jpg" align=left>
Ammon decided to hold a blood drive for his Eagle Project. He enlisted a big group of volunteers and organized the whole thing but he didn't count on one little thing...his project being rejected! Apparently they didn't like it because there weren't enough Scouts involved!! But Ammon, being an honorable young man, didn't want to back out on all the people who had signed up so he went ahead with it all anyway (even though it didn't officially count). Ammon is currently on the lookout for another project. Watch this column to see how it turns out. The twins have now officially turned in their Eagle Project papers as well. Dallas wants to plant a flag pole on the front lawn of the church and Weston wants to build an archery range at Esther Applegate. Good luck boys! Soren, who attends scouts regularly, enjoys the outdoor adventures most but doesn't get to do them as much as he'd like. This is because scouting in the South is very different to scouting in the West (ie: Southern Scouts use motorhomes rather than tents on campouts!) <i>If your scouter hasn't been mentioned in this article, it's because you're not sending in any info.</i> <a href="scouts.html">Scouting Pics</a>

For extra light and fluffy bread only put half the flour in before the first rising. After it has risen you can put the rest of the flour in then knead again and let it rise again. It really works.

<a class=times15><center>Sleeping Outside Part 196: <br>The Return of The Wet Bed</center></a><img src="Pictures/sleep.jpg" align=left>
During Christmas break, Dakota, age 11, was the only person willing to take Diana up on her invitation to sleep outside. It was a chilly night but things seemed to go alright, that is, until morning broke and they woke up in a pool wetness. At first Dakota worried that Grandma had finally lost all bladder control and had wet all over him in the night. Then he was struck by the sudden realization that it might be him! He was horrified. That hadn't happened in years! But he was soaked to the bone so it must have been him. He quietly crept away to avoid the blame but then sheepishly slunk back to apologize when his conscience got the better of him. Grandma was good about it and they decided to clean up the mess together. But as they changed the bedding they realized that something was wrong. After a smell-test they determined that it was actually Diana's fault after all! Not that she had wet the bed but that she had forgotten to mend the hole in the plastic sheeting that she used as protection in case of rain. And it had rained - hard. Dakota breathed a big sigh of relief then ran off to play, leaving Diana to do all the laundry!
