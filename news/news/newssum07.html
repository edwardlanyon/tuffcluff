It is a well established fact that the select band of foolhardy men who have married into the Cluff family have all demonstrated a swift descent into eccentricity, often followed by disturbingly aberrant behavior including the rampant over-breeding of "cute" little dogs and succumbing to an intense desire to cycle the lonely countryside in tight spandex. <br><br>
Until now the women of Cluff have had to endure the suspicious, penetrating stares of the local community; a community beset with rumor and half-truths, gossip and gruesome tales of the horrific maltreatment endured by their persecuted menfolk. Maltreatment precipitating their tragic transition from hunky love-machines into gibbering buffoons. Recently, however, Daisha has hit on a new theory which "proves" that these men were destined for madness already.<br><br>

Upon reading recent research that suggests that left-handed people are "more susceptible to a range of problems, including allergies, auto-immune diseases, depression, drug abuse, epilepsy, schizophrenia and sleeping disorders", Daisha recalled that all of the men who are currently married to Cluff girls are left handed (if one includes Scott and Jeremy, who used to be left-handed). According to the BBC, "Scientists have discovered the first gene which appears to increase the odds of being left-handed.... the Oxford University-led team believes carrying the gene may also slightly raise the risk of developing <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6923577.stm> psychotic mental illness</a>" <br><br>Daisha believes that this offers conclusive proof that these miserable figures have not been driven mad by their marital maltreatment, but that they were schizo-southpaws before they even joined the Cluff-Clan. However, in 1977 a study suggested that up to 15% of the adult population was left-handed. This being the case the probability of 4 out of 4 of these luckless fellows being left-handed through chance is only: 0.15 x 0.15 x 0.15 x 0.15 = 0.000506, or roughly 1 in 2,000!!!<br><br>

So why have so many left-handers got matrimonial with the Cluffettes? Accusations made to Daisha that this statistical aberration and psycho-theory combined to prove that you'd have to be mad to marry a Cluff girl resulted in a severe beating and subjection to repeated watchings of the unsettling Halloween scenes from "Meet me in St Louis". As a consequence this correspondent has felt it wise to submit this article to the Family Times anonymously.... gibber... gibber...

<a class=times15><center>Dane: Karaoke King</center></a><img src="../../Pictures/dane.jpg" align=left>
Dane may be the strong silent type at most family get-togethers, but throw a Karaoke machine into the mix and you might just see a Dane you never knew existed. Singing has always been one of his greatest passions and something he does very well. So when the group started to Karaoke at the recent George reunion Dane threw caution to the wind, put on his party hat and let it all hang out! Rave reviews followed as person after person commented on Dane's extraordinary voice. Talk about hidden talent!

<a class=times15><center>Dirty Bop</center></a> 
"My mouth fell open as I watched the youth practice at the stake center for the upcoming dance festival," says astonished Mother, Diana. "The wicked dance was what we, as teenagers in the 50's, used to call ‘dirty bop’. The night of the performance came and our stake was all dressed up in black & white and poodle skirts. Our stake looked so great, not dirty at all, in fact really strong dancers that could do tough tricks while they danced. Some teenage boys had trouble swinging girls on their shoulders but for our Dallas it was like putting on a scarf."

Either school standards are dropping or money has exchanged hands because Weston has made the honor roll this year! "Hey I got my grades in," reports Weston as he takes a break from his oxygen mask, "and I made the honor roll all the way through freshman year! All A's and B's! Yep, well I thought I'd tell all of you 'cause you thought it not possible!"

This summer the twins have been undergoing a metamorphosis that has culminated in their voices dropping an octave. Their mother, Diana, is thrilled - but mostly because they have finally broken something that they were supposed to for a change!

<a class=times15><center>George Family Reunion</center></a>
Emigrant Lake and the Monty George home were the settings for this summer’s George Family Reunion.  Dane and Tiana came down with their families to join in the fun. Diana hosted a taffy pull to a record-setting 100 relatives. Watching plane tricks brought back memories of days of old. Karaoke was the grand finale with Dane and his children starring.

Once again candles are at the root of yet another game of playing-with-fire-at-the-height-of-fire-season. Like moths drawn to the flame, Dallas, Weston, Ammon and friends sat around a large citronella candle and played chicken.  As their explorations caused the flame to grow higher and higher, an anxious elder (no guesses who) brought a hose and told the teens not to play like that.  Obedient Ammon and friends moved away while the curious twin testers threw a mystery liquid on the candle causing a column of nearly 30 feet to rocket skyward.  “It’s amazing that children even survive into adulthood,” marvels the Twin's mother.

<a class=times15><center>Troutmania!</center></a>
"Cluffs and Troutmans are just crazy about each other," reports a wary Diana. "Ammon and Weston are dating Troutman girls and Kaylynn is dating a Troutman boy. I have had a steady dose of nine teenagers with hormones at their peak running around the house all week - and all this while Dad was in the hospital. The house was messy, they constantly needed feeding and the hormones were thick! It was a nightmare. Help, I need Dennis for support!

Only this time I am not out on the floor doing the actual manual labor. I am in the office where I will be in control of all purchasing, quality control, safety compliance and scheduling of shipments etc.  I work at a desk with a computer and coordinate all the activity between the office the foreman (the job I held before when I left) and the workmen."

<a class=times15><center>Dirty Diana</center></a> </a><img src="../../Pictures/dianabbb.jpg" align=left>
The answer to the question, "Want 100 dumptruck loads of free dirt?" was YES! The price was right so Diana jumped on it and said she'd take it all! They brought the dirt, and kept dumping the dirt till the berms out front began to look small. While out on an errand, the dirt kept coming, even though Diana had meant it to stop. She came back home to a mountain 20 dumptruck loads strong, in the wrong place, and began her task as a human backhoe. 14 hours a day, losing pound after pound she worked herself to near exhaustion. Then to her rescue appeared Tasha, Tiana and Hyrum to finish her earth moving and landscaping. In addition, they took their momentum into her kitchen organizing along the way. A masterpiece was even made of dinner cooked by Tasha, consisting of roast beef with a packet of dry Italian salad dressing sprinkled on top. “It was the yummiest meat I ever tasted,” exclaimed Mom gratefully.

Nearly all of the Cluff children have grown, ripened and been harvested by now but the two youngest offshoots, while still unripe, look to be the biggest crop the Cluffs have produced yet! At the beginning of the summer Dallas was 210 lbs, 6'2" and wore size 15 shoes. Weston lagged slightly behind at a toned 150 lbs. Still, the Cluffs are expected to win the blue ribbon in the giant offspring competition (multiple birth division) at this year's county fair.

<a class=times15><center>The Attack of the Evil Foot!</center></a>
It all started one dark and stormy night when Dennis was suddenly and brutally attacked by his evil foot. In a shocking act of betrayal, the rebellious foot had suddenly turned on him and gone all discolored and swollen. It wasn't long before he was lying in the emergency room with a surgeon prepping his tools for an impending amputation. "They said his foot wasn't healing and that some of it was dead," begins Dennis's horrified wife, Diana. "He is a diabetic and lots of diabetics with this problem end up with their feet hacked off or in a wheelchair for the rest of their life." But just when things looked their darkest, a powerful super-antibiotic swooped in (KA-POW!) and saved the day - and Dennis's foot. Not one to let little something like nearly losing your foot slow him down, Dennis was out of the hospital and back "working like a dog", according to Diana, within a week! That'll teach the wicked foot a lesson!  
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Dennis's Lighthearted Take on Near Tragedy <br><i>"Hospital Food is Not All it is Cracked Up To Be"</i> </center></a><img src="../../Pictures/dennisb.jpg" align=left>
"Type II diabetes is no big deal...," begins Dennis, "until you can only read with klieg lights glaring, you constantly lose your balance because there is no longer any feeling in your feet, you have to go to the bathroom 71 times a day and 33 times in the night and your kidneys begin to scare you. You have nightmares about waking up in an ICU with hoses poking all over in you. Arthritis begins to remind you that you have joints all over your body and all of a sudden your foot swells up and ruptures your shoe and looks like a lobster and ...HURTS like you feel certain that it exploded and there is blood all over the carpet. Ah what the heck, all this comes on so slowly that you are hardly even aware that you are   getting the symptoms. It takes years sometimes and 80% of people in the US are not even aware they have Type II diabetes. Also 90% of diabetics are OVERWEIGHT. The great American dream...Baskin Robins, Soda Pop, Ice Cream, Pizza, Triple Whoppers, Buffet Restaurants, Super Size  - only 39 cents more, all that ready to eat STUFF in the freezer at the supermarket and finally credit cards. MERCY!!! The solution... for goodness sakes - EAT LESS and eat the right thing and exercise regularly. Don't be a frog in a pot as the temperature GRADUALLY increases. Been there, done that! I went to the Doctor to get some help to reduce the swelling and pain and walked over to the hospital and spent 5 days there trying to absorb a 55 gallon drum of antibiotics. Now that I have killed all the bacteria in and on my body, I will have to walk around in a bubble to keep from catching everything under the sun. All my life I have dreamed of getting sick so that I could stay home and get some real rest. Yeah right. After I had slept for most of 24 hours (in segments of 15 minutes at a time because every fifteen minutes some one prances into the room and says, "Are you awake?" or "I am here to get your vitals" or "it's time for your shots" or "its time for your blood sugar thingie" or "here is your food" or "Hi, Mr. Cluff I am here for lab work"! These people all had to attend the Vampire school down in Fresno. Trouble is, they never got any training in finding a vein with a needle. They have gone for the jugular with their teeth. All that sleeping in hospital bed is akin to sleeping on the railroad tracks in a switch yard. Next comes the plastic bag they hang on a tree limb and attach to this conglomeration of needles and hoses and tape festooned to your arm. Then the IV machine begins to beep and stop forcing the stuff into your arm because the pile of pillows under your elevated foot keeps falling off the bed and as your dang near fall off bed trying to retrieve them, mash the IV tube and you push the nurse call button and explain the stupid IV machine is not working again. 45 minutes later a nurse arrives and says, "Can I help you?". But you can't hear her because the foot pillows are now wrapped around your head to drown out the screaming IV machine. It's been so long since you rang, that you can't remember why you called her. That noise is finally quieted, but she leaves your door open so it won't get too stuffy. Then every nurse in the hospital gathers in your hall for a 'can you beat this story" and someone keeps trundling these gargantuan laundry carts up and down the hall just to make sure that you don't waste too much time sleeping.<img src="Pictures/sickfoot.jpg" align=right> 
We won't go into the vicissitudes of Hospital food, nor the difference between male and female nurses. Ambulance Sirens day night, fire 'drills', AND...don't forget the week it took to fill out all the 'admitting and insurance' paperwork, the security, the privacy statements, the "HOLD HARMLESS" forms, and finally the bedside table with the 'safety is our prime concern' folding card. The 55 gallon drum of ICE water and cups with bent straws and lids that won't stay secure so that you have to change your HOSPITAL GOWN.  A box of kleenex and a trash receptacle taped to the side of the table. A book you 'think' you are going to get to read, your glasses some pens and writing paper. The hospital rules and a TY guide that is printed for the Eastern time zone. A bonk on the door and "where would you like me to put your food tray?" You can't put any weight on the foot for a few days, so how do you make it the bathroom 33 times during the night?  That plastic contraption that you attempt to line up in a most awkward position and it feel as flimsy as a zip lock baggie.  Then you have  to be embarrassed and call the nurse to bring another Hospital gown. Your bed faces the door, which also has a sliding curtain, but you have to keep shouting at a nurse to close the one or the other because you do not want to cause embarrassment for the passersby in the hall because that stupid Hospital gown "covers" the wrong side of your body. Can all that happen in five days?   YES - over and over and over. All I really wanted to do was to let you know that I am at home and on the mend, and to sincerely thank you from the bottom of my foot for your prayers. You are all very special to me and I am aware that it is because of the help of each of you that I AM on the mend. That is really all I wanted to do...but I could not help myself.

<a class=times15><center>Johnson's Prego Surprise!</center></a><img src="Pictures/tiaprego.jpg" align=left>
"After a fertility baby (Talea)," says Tiana, "and a “we can do this without assistance?” surprise (Hyatt), we just found out that we are expecting our third child…another surprise! We’re still trying to figure out what caused it, but we’re thinking Hyrum’s birthday must have had something to do with it. We’re very excited. We took on a pretty big remodel project and now are at the selling/completion stage, so yes, we have been up to something besides making babies. It’s only 1 baby, thank goodness! I’m getting so much bigger so much faster on this one, so I was thinking in the back of my mind that it was twins. It must just be that it’s my 3rd baby as to why I’m growing so much faster. The ultrasound gave me the official due date of Feb. 16. I can’t tell I’m pregnant from a missed cycle since I’m too irregular, so I just have to rely on noticing the signs my body gives me that I’m pregnant (emotional, peeing a lot, bigger bust, etc). It turns out that I suspected I was pregnant only one week after conception (which means I was 3 weeks along in the pregnancy)! Not too shabby considering I don’t know to watch for the signs since I never know if and when I’ll get pregnant. I’m getting better! With Hyatt I found out when I was 4 weeks along. With Talea, I was 5 weeks along. Funny, isn’t it? We’re not going to find out the sex on this baby since we have one of each, so this will be our first surprise. We’re excited!"

<a class=times15><center>Weston's Friday the 13th</center></a><img src="Pictures/skull.jpg" align=left>
"I never really believed in bad luck and stuff until this last Friday the 13th," says Weston in terror. "I had bad luck all day! First, I was driving home and when I turned off Dead Indian I hit the gravel and my car wouldn't turn. I slammed on the breaks and skidded. I was only going like 10 mph but I hit one of Hassell's dumptruck trailers and badly hurt my car! I just hit the corner of my front bumper but it buckled the front-side panel. It's a bad dent but I'm fixing it now. I went back to the steel dumptruck trailer that I hit and looked at it but there wasn't even a dent! I just painted it! So that was lucky. Brett Hassell saw but he just laughed and didn't care. Next, we went to Emigrant Lake, we swam there for a while and had fun. When we had to leave we tried to drive up this big hill to get out but we were in Ammon's truck and it didn't have four wheel drive, so we didn't make it. We tried one more hill and still didn't make it. So we tried another way across some muddy grass but got stuck! We tried to keep going but every time we moved we would slide towards the lake, it was only like 10 feet away on a slippery slope. We called Nial to come get us and he brought a four wheel drive truck but got stuck too. He kept sliding toward the lake so I started pushing the car and it worked a bit but eventually his tires were touching the lake and my feet were in the muddy water. This was the mud that is really thick and really, really slick!! When the tires spun they kicked a ton of mud up and I was near the wheel so I was getting caked on my arms. We kept going and at one time I slipped and cut my foot and hit my knee, ripping a chunk out of it. It was really deep and it hurt bad!! Every time the water got in it, it stung! So finally he got traction and started going but it was throwing up sooooo much mud and it was all hitting me straight on but I couldn't get out of the way 'cause I was stuck ankle deep in mud. And it was getting in my ear! Even when he was like 30 feet from me it still was flinging mud! My back seriously had about three inches of mud on it. Everyone was laughing at me. So I crashed my car, got stuck twice, cut open my knee and foot, got caked in mud AND Dad was in the hospital! What a day, huh?”

"Our lives are about to change!" exclaims Karen. "The kids keep getting older. They are almost my age now! :-) Funny how it happens that way. We had to take a trip together before our sweet Ammon flew the coop. So we took the family out to have some fun! We stopped at Mom's and picked up the motorhome and away we went. <img src="Pictures/cluffersvac2.jpg" align=right>After visiting Universal Studios, Disneyland, Disneyland CA Adventure and Knott’s Berry Farm were about burned out on amusement parks (you know you've overdone it when your 6 year old cries to lie down when you're at Disneyland!) and decided to catch some rays at Newport Beach. At the beach we had fun body surfing, skimboarding and boogie boarding until the extra salty water washed off all the ample sunblock we kept lathering on ourselves and we all burned super bad. Canyon got the worst of it blistering and peeling and even bleeding! Dane kept us all safe finding good places to spend the night. <img src="Pictures/cluffersvac3.jpg" align=left>He also kept us comfortable keeping the motorhome running the best he could. With Dane having to backpack Dyson everywhere we went and doing all the driving and upkeep on the motorhome, like keeping water and power available since the generator would not always start, I am not sure he had much of a vacation, but I know he loved all the time with his family as we just had fun all together. Even with the loss of Ammon's graduation present, his digital camera with all our vacation pictures on it, our trip was a great adventure and tons of fun! Family traditions! It's not a true Cluff adventure if something does not go wrong!"

<a class=times15><center>American History Extravaganza </center></a><img src="Pictures/washdc.jpg" align=left>
The patriotic month of July saw the Beal and Lanyon families touring historical highlights of the eastern states. The adventure began in Charlottesville, Virginia at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, where they enjoyed the tour of the house, the gardens and the view. Then they spent a day seeing the historic triangle, Colonial Williamsburg, where Tabitha seemed drawn to the British flag (Union Janice), Yorktown and Jamestown Fort and Settlement (John Smith and Pocahontas). Humid and hot outside the shops with air conditioning seemed especially inviting to them all. They sold rock candy, little red riding hood capes, baskets, hats, period products and, most importantly, cold drinks. The following day the group caravanned northward to Washington D.C. where the next several days were spent visiting, passing by, and exploring as much as an ambitious Daisha could get them to do. Some of the highlights included: touring the inside of the Capitol, where Soren and Dakota had to be coaxed into and then pried away from listening to Presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain speak on the floor of the Senate. <img src="Pictures/bealsdc.jpg" align=right>We were the first tourists of the day inside the White House. Daisha asked the guards to tell us any juicy tidbits about each room we visited and we got some good gossip. We walked up the steps to the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorial and saw the National Arboretum. The planned tour to the top of the Washington Memorial was cancelled due to a sudden and violent thunderstorm, to the disappointment of all, especially Daisha. Joseph was delighted with the mud near the monument’s edge. The WWII monument was a convenient place to covertly dip muddy hands and feet into. The Vietnam Memorial’s black wall was sobering to all except energetic Joseph. Also somber was the Holocaust Museum, of which we only saw the children’s section. We did eat at the restaurant, wondering if we would find Holocaust food served. The National Air and Space Museum was favored by the males in the group. The females seemed more impressed with the a temporary exhibit from the Smithsonian’s American History Museum of Dorothy’s ruby slippers, Abe Lincoln’s top hat, Scott’s Member’s Only jacket (last member), R2D2 and C3PO from Star Wars, a Stradivarius, and the Nauvoo Temple Sunstone. Daisha found a factory for us to tour in The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, where paper (actually a cotton and linen blend) money is made. In the National Gallery, Mel and Daisha were surprised to find Fragonard’s “A Young Girl Reading” along with a varied collection of highly recognizable works. Daisha was heard to whisper, “Don’t tell Edward but I think this is even better than the National Gallery in London.” <img src="Pictures/lanyondc.jpg" align=left>We saw a glimpse of the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution at the National Archives. Mount Vernon, the home of George and Martha Washington, was one of the final destinations for the tourists. Daisha and Edward took a slight detour on the way to Mount Vernon and ended up whipping through the city one more time (whoops!). Back at the hotel Tabitha and Joseph seemed to especially enjoy the swimming pool. While changing out of wet swim suits Tabitha caught a glimpse of Joseph’s “Peanut” and said “nasty!” Dakota mastered the waffle iron at the breakfast bar. Edward was heard to confess, “Anything other than Taco Bell for the fourth day in a row.” “Touring together was wonderful,” says Melanie, “and as the two youngest get a little older, it may get even better. It can only get better for them!”

<a class=times15><center>Lanyons Cruise the Med</center></a>
The Lanyons set sail on a two week western Mediterranean cruise in August. They flew to the Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain and boarded their casual English cruise liner. They went to Italy (Sardinia, Rome, Florence, Pisa, Genoa, La Spezia, Cinque Terre, Portofino and Santa Margherita), France (Villefranche, Marseille), Spain (Barcelona, Valencia, Majorca and Menorca) and Monaco. They had a great time exploring what Daisha says is her favorite part of the world. "I've never been anywhere that I like better," Daisha says with a dreamy look in her eye. "Both Edward and I agreed, based on the places we visited, that Italy was the best. But everything was fantastic! So much so that I actually began to feel guilty that something bad hadn't happened - I am a Cluff after all, and a trip just isn't a trip without a major disaster." The Lanyon children enjoyed themselves as well, in fact so much so that it was a chore for them to leave the boat and go on shore excursions. Dakota hung out with the cool kids in the teen club everyday until 11:30 pm! Tabitha loved the onboard entertainment especially the dancing girls, the balloon animals and the face painting. Edward liked the days at sea where he could relax and eat at much as he wanted at the 24hr English-comfort-food buffet (with everything from trifle to black pudding -yuck). The cruise was so successful that the Lanyons have already booked another one for Easter in the Caribbean.

<a class=times15><center>A Merry Ol' English Jaunt</center></a><img src="Pictures/lon.jpg" align=left>
This summer the Lanyons welcomed various relatives back to the motherland for their annual vacations. Uncle Ron and Aunt Bev were first to visit but, unfortunately, hit England during the rainiest month on record. Un-phased by the floods they soldiered on and drove out to visit family genealogical sights via Stonehenge. Unfortunately they hit Stonehenge at the summer solstice and were caught in a tidal wave of hippies, druids and weirdoes from around the globe. After a few days of graveyard-hopping they returned to the Lanyons but, unfortunately, got zapped by a speed camera en route. Fortunately, England doesn't prosecute foreign visitors who get speeding tickets so they got to have a wild life-in-the-fast-lane-crime-spree and escape all the consequences. Let that be a lesson to all Americans, next time you’re in England you can disregard all the laws because you’re untouchable! Hooray! Next came Cage for two weeks of castle-hopping, countryside touring and London sight-seeing. Highlights for her were the London Harry Potter Tour, the art museums and a proper (la-dee-dah) English tea party. Now, it’s YOUR turn to visit!

This summer will be a lucky one because, as we all know, seven is a lucky number and on a certain date in July (07/07/07) you'll have triple the good luck! But watch out because no sooner have you had your lucky day than a nasty Friday the 13th comes along to spoil it all. Improve your chances by checking out our good/bad luck-themed movie list this quarter.<br>
<br>
<b>JUNE:</b><br>
Prepare to counteract next month's Friday the 13th early by checking out <b>Freaky Friday</b> (1976) for a few tips. Learn what not to do from Jodie Foster in order to avoid magically switching places with your mom- ugh! Best line: "Ah! Macaroni and cheese, breakfast at last". Best name: Toss up between "Boris" and "Mrs. Schmauss". Best summed up in two words: guilty pleasure. 
<br>
<br>
<b>JULY:</b><br>
You probably know that July is the 7th month of the year and that 7 is a lucky number, but did you know that filmmakers love the number 7? There's <b>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</b> (and the Indian version, <b>Satte Pe Satta</b>), <b>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</b>, <b>The Seven Year Itch</b>, <b>Seven Alone</b>, <b>Seven Years in Tibet</b>, and there are even movies called <b>Seven</b> and <b>7</b>! But there's more, we all love <b>The Magnificent Seven</b>, but did you know that it was based on an excellent Japanese film called <b>Seven Samurai</b>? So Magnificent Seven was a rip off Seven Samurai but then (and here's where it gets weird) <b>The Three Amigos</b> was a rip off of Magnificent Seven, plus <b>A Bug's Life</b> was a rip off of them all! There are so many seven options, why not try to watch seven Seven movies this month, maybe it'll bring you good luck. 
<br>
<br>
<b>AUGUST:</b><br> <img src="Pictures/stpatrick.jpg" align=left>
If you wish a little 'luck o' the Irish' would rub off on you then watch a young James Bond in <b>Darby O'Gill and the Little People</b> (1959) and maybe it will. This is a dated but fun movie from the Disney vault and one that I'm sure Sean Connery would rather was kept under wraps. Still it's a good laugh. But I didn't always think so - as a child this movie gave me more nightmares than any other (stinkin' banshee). Though now when I look back at it I'm stunned I was so convinced by the terrible banshee graphics. In scenes where I used to wet my pants with fear, kids of today would probably wet their pants with laughter!
<br>
<br>
<b>WILDCARD:</b><br>Despite being a story about striking it rich, the wildcard movie this summer is an antidote to all of this silly nonsense about bad and good luck. <b>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</b> (1948) is a sober reminder that life is not fair. It's about friends, enemies, greed and guilt. It's a fantastic character study and surprisingly fun for the whole family. How could they resist Howard, the spry old codger or the humorous Mexican bandits; "Badges, we don't need no stinking badges!"?<br>

<a class=times15><center>Who Fluffed?!</center></a> <img src="Pictures/question.jpg" align=left>
Fluffy, fluff, fluffed, fluffer...we are all more than familiar with this famous Cluff euphemism for umm... shall we say, "gastrointestinal disturbances" but, until now, no one knew where this Cluff-tastic word came from. Now Tuffcluff is proud to reveal that the origin of the fluff is a mystery no longer! Drum roll please. The clever person behind this famous "Cluff" word is… not even a Cluff at all (shock/horror)! The word, as we use it today, was invented more than 25 years ago by none other than Aunt Beverly! Pre-fluff, the poor Tuffcluff's had to make do with lame-o clichéd expressions such as "passed-air" or "passed-gas" - hardly the loveable, catchy little word we've all grown accustomed to. But then along came Aunt Bev's stroke of genius and everything changed! Now Cluffs the world over can enjoy this punchy, versatile word with the built-in bonus feature of a face-saving euphemism! It's a word that we've all come to depend upon, a real Cluff tradition. So if your child says anything else, it's time for a history lesson. Long live the fluff! <i>Coming Soon on Tuffcluff: More Cluffy etymological breakthroughs.</i>

<a class=times15><center>Mom Resorts to "The Cane"</center></a>
"One thing I've noticed about really tall boys," reveals a disgruntled Diana, "is that they don't mind! It's hard to handle three teenage sons that are six foot and one who is over 200 lbs! I have to go out and get a 12 foot tall piece of bamboo and wave it back and forth at them in a threatening way just to get them to do anything! I got the bamboo idea from watching bears and other animals standing up on their hind legs to make themselves look taller! If that doesn't work I call Dad who tells them, 'I can still take you down, don't think I can't!'"

<a class=times15><center>Cops Nab Dallas for Drunkenness</center></a><img src="../../Pictures/dallasb.jpg" align=left>
Dallas was subjected to a field sobriety test on the 4th of July. At first he thought it was because he jumped out of the back of Ammon's pick-up before it stopped but it turned out that another similar truck with boys in the back had been guilty of throwing fireworks at policemen that night. So Dallas was apprehended and forced to undergo a full-on sobriety test. All through the test he giggled at the absurdity of it all - he, who doesn't even drink caffeinated beverages, was being tested for alcohol!! Even so Dallas managed to stamp on the policeman's foot, fluff loudly and fall over twice. The poor policeman submitted Dallas to every test he had, he was sure he was guilty, but Dallas passed with flying colors and walked away from a very confused cop.

<a class=times15><center>Weston's Tragic Tale -<br> The Saga Continues</center></a>
After last year's mind-blowing revelation that Weston's mother forgot that she actually spelled his name WesT-E-N at birth (see: "15 Years of Child Neglect: Weston's Tragic Tale" in the <a href='newswin0607.html'>Winter 2006/07 Edition</a>), the plot thickens. "The other day I needed my birth certificate for something," begins the poor boy, "and upon looking at it I realized that my name IS spelled WesT-O-N! I don't know what mom was looking at [that originally caused her to remember that it was WesT-E-N after 15 years] unless have a fake. So in the school records, my name is spelt "EN" but I guess it is actually "ON" after all."

"I don't know what to say," begins Karen in reaction to her son's recent graduation, "My first baby! All grown up and off to conquer the world!" Ammon is not just Dane and Karen's first child, he is the first Tuffcluff grandchild and nephew as well. Before he left school he went on a fun senior trip to a water park in Seattle and also gave a little going away present to his classmates - in the form of a special Ammonesque dance. "He and his friend, Paul, did their dance that they did with the lunch ladies every day in the lunchroom," reports Karen, "only this time they did it in front of the entire graduation group to pay tribute to their years of working in the lunchroom with the awesome lunch ladies. They had a great time!" Graduation over, it came time for Ammon to spread his wings and take flight. First he flew south to spend a little time at Grandma and Grandpa's house. "After spending a few months in Ashland working," continues Karen, "Ammon is back home working with Dane and about to register for SWOCC. Mission only months away, he is going to work hard to make as much money as he can and get as much schooling as possible and probably get in as much dating as he can to make up for the 2 years he'll have without any girls! Great job Ammz!! We are super happy with your choices! It's great to see you so happy too."

<a class=times15><center>Spurned!</center></a>
"Our cockatiel, Spur, flew the coop," reports Tiana with a sneaky smile. "It always chirped loudly when it heard the dogs bark because it learned that their barking often times is a signal for Hyrum’s arrival. It loved Hyrum, so it would make a ruckus in hopes that Hyrum will come give it some attention. Well, I was leaving for a walk with the kids and Scout, but the other dogs were jealous so they started barking, and through the barking I heard a familiar noise. I could hear Spur, our cockatiel, screeching somewhere outside. I had no idea it had even been outside that day (Talea takes it out on occasion to play, but she’d been warned not to take it out anymore because we needed to clip its wings again). I went around the house and found it in the upper branches of my neighbor’s Myrtle tree. There was no way to reach it and my neighbor was at work, so I left on my walk thinking I would have Hyrum coax it home after he came home from work. Sadly, by the time he got home, the bird was no where to be found. We tried making the dogs bark, but we never heard it chirp again. It had escaped once before and flown over two fences to an unfamiliar neighbor’s yard, but they had informed us they found it the next day and it was returned unharmed. I think this time Spur either flew farther away, or a predator got him. I’m not too sad about it because I couldn’t stand its poop and fluff, but Hyrum really liked him, so I felt bad for him."

<a class=times15><center>Celeb Stalkers</center></a><img src="../../Pictures/cage.jpg" align=left>
"Every time we drive home," reports Cage, "we always see one of those black towncars that important people/celebs drive around in with hired drivers. One day my mom and I became curious about that day's towncar so we followed it. The car passed our street and continued up the main street and went through about three big intersections. We followed it down another back road and even had to purposefully turn onto a parallel street so the chauffeur wouldn't suspect. After following the black car for about fifteen minutes, it finally pulled into a apartment complex. We followed it down the narrow street and watched it turn down an alley. We drove past the alley and I saw the car parked at the end of the alley. I watched to see if anyone got out of the car, but no one did. As my mom and I started driving out of the complex, we decided the towncar was going to pick someone up. My mom also said the car had been going way too slow to have been dropping someone off. Anyway, after the whole episode I told my mom, "This is sooo  going on TuffCluff!"... and I guess it has!"

<a class=times15><center>Yard Work</center></a><img src="Pictures/yardtools.jpg" align=left>
At the end of the summer Tiana, Hyrum and Tasha descended on the homestead to help put a dent in the never ending yard work. "We cleared a path going from the playground to the field," says an exhausted, pregnant Tiana. "It looks great! Tasha weed-eated a lot and it looks so nice now. Hyrum spent the day running a bobcat skidster fixing the berms and moving dirt around. He made such a difference! He made the pile at the end of the driveway a parking area and the field berms are higher and the playground and coop are surrounded with a berm to keep floods out. There’s a chicken run between the playground berm and the property line. Apparently the chickens are too stupid to know how to climb the berm or go through the stick fence barrier. We were worn out by the end of the day and the shower water was black with dust when we finally cleaned up. Oh, the drain in the tub is of course clogged as always, so the tub looked like a cesspool after each dirt-filled shower. We’re covered in bruises and scratches but it was worth it because it actually looks sooo good!!"

<img src="Pictures/eagle.jpg" align=left>
In a fitting tribute to the centenary scouting celebrations, Dakota, age 12, has finally decided to join up. Dakota's troop was celebrating this year too with their 95th anniversary (only 5 years after the first ever scout campout!) Within a week of joining Dakota was a key player in the Annual Village Fete (fun fair) where he received praise for going above and beyond the call of duty. Then a few weeks later Dakota went off to scout camp for the first time. Although scouting started in England, scout camp in the UK is not quite as manly as its American counterpart. For one thing it's co-ed, which meant they had discos. Discos at SCOUT CAMP! What next?! Anyway, at least Dakota did learn some useful survival skills...like scuba diving! Both Dallas and Weston are working hard to complete their Eagle Projects. Dallas will be putting up a flag pole for church and Weston will be building an archery range at Ester Applegate. <i>If your scouter hasn't been mentioned in this article, it's because you're not sending in any info.</i> <a href="scouts.html">Scouting Pics</a>

<a class=times15><center>How to Avoid Getting Sick <br>in Three Easy Steps</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/vomfest.jpg" align=left>
To avoid getting sick with colds, flu, hay fever or any other bug going around, each day:<br>
<b>1.</b> Take one chopped clove of <b>garlic</b> before going to bed everyday.<br>
<b>2.</b> <b>Sleep outside</b> (winter is the best at about 17 degrees, as the air is cold and refreshing). Wear two or three layers of thermals or sweat pants and tops plus a coat with a hood and gloves in cold weather. Put wool socks and warm slippers on the feet. Use an extra warm sleeping bag that goes to 10 degrees with a warm blanket inside and you will feel very warm. When the weather is warmer use a regular sleeping bag and regular sweats. To waterproof the outside bed, put a long sheet of clear plastic on the mattress and fold it to go over the sleeping bag and pillow area for rain, snow, hail and frost. Tuck in the sides of plastic for windy and rainy nights. I sometimes wake up in a soaked bed if it's not all tucked in on the sides during rainstorms. When thunderstorms come, the clear plastic is great for viewing the lightning but maybe it's not good to be out in those storms as getting hit by lighting or a falling tree is a risk. My great grandfather Hassell was killed in a lighting storm when a tree fell on the tent he and three other men were in. Another man died too. For summer when the sun is going to ruin the plastic and sleeping bag, use an old blanket over the plastic on the bed to protect it from the sun. The moon, stars and clouds are so fun to see before going to sleep. Sleeping out is the most fun I have each day. I wake up very refreshed with lots of energy at five or six a.m. each day sleeping outside. I love to see the pink clouds of the sunrise, the honking ducks flying by and the birds and squirrels playing in the trees. It is fun to see spiders riding the wind too. When indoors, I have to drag myself out at seven a.m. feeling tired and still sleepy. Sleeping out is the only thing that has helped me get up early each day. <br>
<b>3.</b> <b>Go on a daily walk</b>. When I wake up I pop on my tennis shoes, as I am already dressed with sweats and a coat, and go for a fast morning walk for half a mile. <br>
These things have kept me from catching any bugs all year long - even if I am taking care of and living with sick people. Fresh air is a huge immune booster and energy builder. The night sky is worth all the extra clothes you have to wear to sleep outside in the winter too.

<a class=times15><center>Diana's "Special" Fire Escape Plan</center></a><img src="Pictures/fireman.jpg" align=left>
"The first night Dad was in the hospital the fire alarm went off and he was on the top floor," Diana begins. "A nurse came in and told him that there was a fire and said she was shutting his door. It reminded me of 9/11 when all the poor people in the twin towers were told to stay in their offices when the planes hit and the ones that minded, died. I decided right then that if anyone ever told me to stay in my room in a skyscraper emergency, I wouldn't. If I were Dad and the nurse had shut my door, I would have jumped up, grabbed the back of my nasty hospital gown and run down the stairs to get outside. I don't trust people that are suppose to be in charge anymore. If anyone tried to stop me, I'd put on a frantic looking face and yell the magic word - 'DIAHARIA!!' The only drawback is that it would be a scary sight to be the only one standing outside the hospital in a peek-a-boo gown as people showed up for the fire." 
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Diana's New Obsession: Swishing</center></a>
Diana has taken up swishing. The only thing is that it is with oil! She has plenty of reasons for choosing oil over mouthwash, but none of them involves the words fresh, minty or clean. Apparently every morning she swishes the oil for 15-20 minutes while also trying to get the boys ready for school. Talk about multitasking! She tries to tell the boys to comb their hair but instead it sounds like, "PHOMM HRR HUH". She tells them to eat their breakfast but it just comes out, "HEE HRR HEH-HUH". Not the sort of thing you like to hear first thing in the morning. Indeed the first time she tried oil swishing, her poor unsuspecting boys actually thought she was having a stroke! If nothing else, at least she's found a new way to get the boy's attention in the morning.

<a class=times15><center>Sleeping Outside Part 218: <br> Whilst Traveling</center></a>
As we all know Diana is completely dedicated to sleeping outdoors. But what happens when she goes away on a vacation or a weekend trip? "I sleep on the roof of the motorhome," she reveals, "with a machete." Beware motorhome theives!

Diana has recently confessed that, "sleeping out is the most fun I have each day." It's a sad commentary on a person's life when sleeping, the state of being comatose, is their favorite part of the day. Bearing this in mind, Tuffcluff is launching a charity appeal to save Diana! All it takes is just one good joke a day, or, if you can't afford that, perhaps one small Skype a week. Please give generously, your help is needed more now than ever.
