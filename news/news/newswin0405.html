Dallas Cluff is recovering after a brush with death at the hands of his own mother, Diana! After suffering from an aneurysm three years ago Diana was left with impaired vision in her left eye but was subsequently given the 'all clear' to drive from the DMV. So she continued to drive half blind without incident, but then disaster struck. "As we drove up to the church," says Diana, "Dallas opened the door before I had stopped the car. I felt a bump and knew that I had run over something. I asked what I'd hit and Weston said, 'It's okay Mom, it was just Dallas!' Luckily the tire had only caught Dallas's foot and he was okay, in fact he acted like nothing had happened at all! I don't know if he will hurt later or if it just doesn't hurt to have your foot run over. Oh well, win some lose some!"

“Nial and the Twins took their first adventure road trip to Coquille this winter,” reports Diana. “While they were gone the house was like a tomb without wild wrestling going on 15 hours a day. They had fun visiting Dane and Tiana's families but spent all of the food money and half of the gas money I sent with them on candy and junk food. They drove home on gas-fumes, with sore throats, vomiting and the trots.”

This year the Cluffs kicked off the Christmas season with a traditional trip downtown to see the lights. The weather co-operated in providing an appropriately festive atmosphere with a generous dusting of snow. "All the 18 wheeler trucks were lined up for miles along the freeway to chain up for going over the mountain," says Diana. "I am so sorry the people here are not like the Norway people where they build tunnel after tunnel to go through their big tall mountains. I feel like we are retarded in our traffic problems compared to them."

New Year just wouldn't be New Years without Diana's infamous 'Evil Knievel Dress'. "I wore it for 20 years," says a dreamy-eyed Diana. "I love white or silver glitter for evening as it attracts the light and sparkles and makes you look like your wearing a Cinderella dress." But the only legs the Knievel has covered in the past couple decades have been table legs because it is now part of an elaborate New Years Eve dining room centerpiece. Check out our next edition of Cluff News for more on Diana's obsession with centerpieces.

After their wedding in June, newlyweds Shira and Jeremy moved into a temporary shanty (built by Jeremy) in his parent's back yard. But recently they've abandoned their love shack for a cosy Portland apartment. They claim the move is so that Jeremy can finish his schooling, but there is some speculation that shoddy insulation combined with the onset of winter are the real reasons for the couple's hasty exodus.

"The Johnson's have just had seven puppies," reports Diana. "We saw them all wildly nursing on one of the mothers couple of weeks ago.

<a class=times15><center>Fabulous Prize Winning White Elephant Story!</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/wele.jpg" align=left>
Congratulations to Dallas, our Cluff Family Times white elephant story contest winner! Actually, no one else even entered the contest so Dallas won just by entering (heaven knows his grammar and spelling didn't win it for him). The next closest contender was Nial who, for his birthday, got what every 17 year-old boy dreams about: socks and handkerchiefs! To add insult to injury the items were then taken away to be stored for his mission - a mere TWO YEARS away! Who knows, had Nial entered his story he might have won the DVD of his choice (Dallas chose The Incredibles). Could your story have won? Keep an eye out for upcoming contests and get writing! The following is Dallas's prize-winning story in its original form:<br>
<i> "for my white elfont story i will tell you about the time when daisha gave me a can of eddie babcocks "tomatos"! it was christmas every one was up earile, exept for mom and dad. daisha & dakota were at the at the house. when mom & dad finly got up we went in to the living room and the first things we opend were the whitwe elfont presents daisha gave to us, every one got theres so then it was my turn i opend my present and there was a can of rotten old can of eddie babcock's caned "tomatos", (they must have been over 20 or 30 years) so no one could open them exept for dad, and when he did the nasties most grose smell filled the room, then suddenly we looked at the bottle and the "tomatos" and they had risen hafe way out of the jare, it was the nasstyes thing EVER!!but the worst ting is that now a year latter the cubored is still full of the same cans of "tomatos". </i>

<a class=times15><center>X-ray-ted Adventure</center></a>
"Weston gets such bad headaches," Diana reports, "that he falls down on the floor and screams with pain as he holds his head and feels like he’s going to throw up. I took him to the hospital to get an x-ray and they said everything was alright. After the hospital I wanted to go for a walk in the park, but it was getting dark so I took the twins with me for protection. Weston came but Dallas wouldn't, so we went ahead without him. On our way back we met Dallas and he told us that he’d been confronted by three druggy kids. A girl got in front of him and wouldn't move and started saying things like ‘take off your pants’ and more. Dallas said he knew he could take them out, but restrained himself and finally got the kids to move so he could pass using his words only. I was proud he found a way out of it all."

<a class=times15><center>New Drivers on Board</center></a><img src="Pictures/ltag.jpg" align=left>
<b>On Your Left:</b> Heavily pregnant Daisha has passed her English driving test, a difficult task after 15 years of driving on the right-hand side of the road. Daisha was forced to take 12 driving lessons, learn basic mechanics and pass a long theory test before she was eligible to take her practical driving test on the narrow old streets of Britain. "I'd never want to drive there in a million years," says Daisha's mother Diana. "They have so many narrow streets where a head-on is a constant possibility."<br> 
<b>Americans Beware:</b> The news that Nial has passed his driving test has sent shock waves throughout the Cluff community. Partly because we've all seen Nial drive but mostly because it's the first test in the last five years that he's actually passed!<br> 
<b>Fam Van Man:</b> Ammon planned to take his driving test on his 16th birthday using the small car he'd practised on for a year, unfortunately the car was put out of commission in an accident just before his birthday and he was forced to take the family van instead - with disastrous consequences. Poor Ammon failed his test - but that wasn't the worst of it - now he's got a reputation for being the kind of guy who drives a mini-van! <br>
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Birthday Bashes</center></a><img src="Pictures/bday.jpg" align=left>
<b>Terrible Teens:</b> For the first time in 41 years, the Cluff's have no "children" left in the house. "The twins finally turned 13," says delighted mother, Diana "so all we have left in the house now are teenagers. For their birthday the boys had a slumber party and played dodge ball. I took them ice skating in the park then out for a whopper at Burger King (small size, as I am seeing too much body on them) then to Wal-Mart for presents; a fly fishing pole for Weston and a BB gun for Dallas. I'm worried about the windows in the motor home now though. We also had cake and a movie." Nial’s participation in the two-day party was low - instead he observed the spectacle with quiet contempt. To see why, read the article in this edition entitled 'Fabulous Prize Winning White Elephant Story!'<br>
<b>Senior Citizen Alert:</b> Diana enjoyed a surprise 60th birthday party organized by Dennis, Grandma Anna and LaVona. There was good food and good times to be had by all who attended. The evening was rounded off by stories from Grandma Anna and Elmont about Diana's childhood in Bluewater. "We had a good time," said the birthday girl's husband, Dennis, "and Diana looked as pretty and young as she always does."

<a class=times15><center>What Are Those Cluff Boys Up To?</center></a>
"The boys have just returned from Winter Snow Camp," says their mother, Diana. "They hiked four miles to a cabin at Diamond Lake with snow shoes and big heavy backpacks. They said it was hard and cold but real fun. I am glad we have the Scout program to make men of them. All three boys are taking music lessons from a friend who borrowed and broke Dallas's base guitar and is giving free lessons to make up for it. The twins are still wrestling each other constantly and using their twin language so that we can't understand what they say. Nial is still a low key man and still has gorgeous girls calling and begging him to take them on a date."<br> 
<b>WESTON:</b> "The Missionaries gave Weston a Book of Mormon," says a jubilant Diana, "and Weston took it to school to read. People saw the book and started asking him if it was the Bible or what. Weston told them what it was and soon there was a crowd around him, including a teacher, asking him questions about Mormons and what they believe. Many were saying they had Mormons friends. It made him very popular. Now for Christmas he wants the Book of Mormon on CD! I am sure Santa will give him his wish. Weston was also the star of his health class when a student said, 'we are all kind of wild, we should be more like Weston who never cusses. He is really strong but he doesn't fight anyone and is kind to all of us.' I’m so proud of Weston."<br>
<b>DALLAS:</b> 
Dallas, thirteen, is 170lb, 5' 6" with a 40" waist and size 11 shoe now. "We took Dallas to the doctor," says concerned mother, Diana, "to check the nasal problem he's had since a baby. It affects his speech and breathing. The doctor said his passages are swollen but thinks he can help. This is the third doctor we've taken him to. Hopefully it works. Dallas and Weston spent one whole Saturday helping put Allen Hassell's new barn roof on. It was a normal weekend for them, they love to serve others for many hours each week. They are very kind boys."<br>
<b>NIAL:</b>Nial is doing rock climbing at school, has just passed his driving test and is working to finish his Eagle. "He hasn't driven on his own yet," says his mother, Diana, "as he needs to become an Eagle Scout first, which was what we all agreed to when he took the test. Nial has met with Lithia Park officials and is going to do an Eagle project for them (making trails) in the next few days. Nial is growing up and getting better grades now. They could even be higher if he would show up for school on time. He often walks or rides his bike as his bus comes before 7:30 and he frequently misses it. Nial is working on a magazine table in woodshop that he will have for his future home. He is also is working, three days a week, at the Jet Center in Medford. He cleans the mechanic's shop and is learning to drive the gas truck."

<img src="Pictures/wreck.jpg" align=left>
Karen Cluff, mild-mannered super mom, was driving along with her daughter at the speed limit (30 mph), minding her own business, when suddenly a car turned in front of her! She slammed on her brakes but it was too late - they collided. Her car was totalled and her air bag was deployed but she and Kaylynn were able to walk away from the accident with only a few bruises to the arms and chest. The other driver's insurance should cover everything, given that it was their fault, but that fact doesn't satisfy Ammon who was forced to take the minivan for his driver's test as a result of the incident.

"Yesterday I was almost struck by a car pulling into my lane when I was about to go onto the freeway," says a terrified Diana. "Our car would have been smashed if I hadn't run off the road in self defense. The man must not have seen me coming as I have a grey car and it was cloudy and foggy. Then last week I almost got it with a semi truck, but this time it was my fault. I was driving in the Wal-Mart parking lot, it was raining and dark, I passed a parked semi and didn't see another semi coming. I hit the brakes and then saw he couldn't stop, so I hit the gas and decided I wouldn't use the parking lot for driving anymore as it is 'truck city' now. Another thing that happened was that I fell asleep for the first time in my life while driving home from Coquille. I had told Dad I was sleepy and he was going to drive but I couldn't pull over for a while as we were in a construction zone. So next thing I knew I woke up hitting the grooves in road that are there to wake people up when they fall asleep. I was shocked to have fallen asleep but was glad that we pray twice a day and ask for protection. All prayers are answered with Yes, No or Wait. I am glad we’ve had yes these last few times."

"We almost didn't have water at our home anymore," reports Diana. "I hadn't been able to take a bath for two days as there wasn't enough water for dishes, washing and baths. I was almost ready to start using the creek water but decided to pray for help instead. Then Dallas found a major leak behind the pond under the bamboo. I love bamboo and plant it everywhere, even close to our house though I know you're not supposed to as its roots ruin your foundations. I never thought it would get our water pipes. Now the leak is fixed and we have our water back, but I'm not getting rid of my bamboo!"

If you are planning a visit to the Cluff house this year, the main thing to remember is do not (I repeat, DO NOT) eat anything containing eggs! This year it should be especially hard to avoid since their chicken coop is bursting at the seams with 22 laying hens! But the hens aren't the real problem, the real problem is the rooster! Having a rooster makes each egg a serious gamble. Then why have a rooster? Dennis explains, "I bought 24 baby chicks last year because every year we lose half a dozen or more to racoons and possums. Also, usually about 25% of the batch ends up being roosters, but last year we only ended up with two! We ate one and that left 22 hens and one rooster. With the newly repaired chicken coop we didn’t lose any hens to predators and almost all of them lay eggs. Now we have eggs all over the place that we are trying to get rid of." The problem is that, with a rooster, some of those eggs are ticking time bombs. Dennis stars in the latest drama in a long list of bad egg stories; "Dad called me from work," Diana reports, "and said 'throw out all the boiled eggs, I just bit into one and I almost threw up!' Then the tone of his voice changed; he coughed, gagged, threw down the phone and ran out of the room yelling, 'I'm going to throw up!' I couldn't stop laughing!"

Nial joined the rock-climbing club at school and is already competing. He came in 6th at a big competition in Bend after only a month of practice. "Nial climbs three times a week and loves it," says his proud mother, Diana. "His thin body (135lbs) is a plus in all this but climbing makes him so exhausted that he is wiped out for a day and sore for many days afterwards. Nial mostly does the indoor climbing walls but he and a friend have done some cliff climbing with ropes at the Lake too. I don't like him climbing on big rocks outside. I want to go see him climb at his meets but he doesn't want me to. I guess I'll have to watch him when he is in town, or not give him the money to go to the big meets if he won't let me go with him!" Nial's next big competition is in Portland.

<a class=times15><center>The Infamous Twins</center></a>
"The twins are into basketball now and having lots of games," says their mother, Diana. "It doesn't matter where we go, people from all over the valley know the twins and who their parents are. We don't know them and we don't how they know us but as soon as we walk into a game people everywhere say, 'you must be here to see the Cluff twins.' The boys have made some baskets but are heavy and so their running isn't the fastest. When you see them in their uniforms, you can see how much bigger their arms and legs are than the other boys. They would be good wrestlers as they have practiced since the womb, but wrestling isn't offered."

<a class=times15><center>Tree Trouble</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/xmastre.jpg" align=left> 
Having a troublesome Christmas tree is a long-standing Cluff tradition. For instance, Diana, who loves bushy trees, was always dissatisfied with what the forest had to offer and so every year had to lash two trees together to get the look she wanted. The problem then was how to disguise the join. She solved it with heavy flocking – a practice now banned in 39 states for being a crime against tastefulness. Everyone has their own idea of the perfect tree. Tiana, in direct opposition to her mother, prefers slim-line trees.  “We bought our tree from the boy scouts in our ward,” says a ticked-off Tiana, “and the dumb thing was a bush instead of a tree. You know the ones that when you put the ornaments on they kind of stick out instead of hang? That's what I had. It was really weird for me because I'm used to trees with spaces between the branches. It worked out alright, but it died long before Christmas so I had to take it down on the 26th, and there were more needles on the floor afterward than there were on the tree. Next year I'm getting the tree I want. No more of this pity for the boy scouts stuff, unless they decide to sell decent trees.”
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Wicked! &copy; </center></a>
Diana loves being original. It’s her thing. So when people begin to copy her ideas, she doesn’t take to it kindly (see ‘Global Fashion Trends Traced Back to Mother of Ten’ in the <a href='newsfal04.html'> Fall 2004 Edition </a>), or at the very least feels she is entitled to compensation or recognition. “I turned on Fox news,” says a disgruntled Diana, “and in big letters across the screen was; ‘WICKED WEATHER!’ I couldn't believe it, the ‘wicked’ word I have been using for years is now the big funny word in the US. Nial and the twins let me know that everyone says ‘wicked’ these days to be funny. I’m such a trend-setter.”

<a class=times15><center>Rest Home</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/old.jpg" align=left> 
“The twins told me,” begins Diana, “that the majority of the kids at their school have parents younger than their own big brothers, Dane and Bart. Even though most of the middle schooler’s parents are in their thirties, the twins still hug and kiss me when I show up at their school. They are proud to have a grandmother-aged mother. They feel unique and like to tell our ages to the other students. None of the kids or teachers can believe it. The twins don’t mind having a mother that can’t go to school conferences because of the old age ailments of heart attack, aneurysms, arthritis and hearing loss. They love getting out the bed tray and bringing us meals. The prophecy our first batch made about having more children in our forties has come true; the boys come home from school and we are sleeping on the couch with the TV blasting and our mouths wide open. They get to do all the cleaning, yard work and cooking when we don’t feel like it. The only thing they don't do yet is change our diapers.” 
<hr>
<a class=times15><center>Chunky Lunch Chuckers</center></a><img src="Pictures/lunch.jpg" align=left>
“The twins are so big now,” says an overwhelmed Diana, “they look me in the eye and laugh when I tell them to do anything. They aren’t just tall but they’re heavy too. I’m the small mother with big boys bossing her. They’re only heavy because of school lunches, in the summer they lose ten pounds with my food. I tried sending lunches to school with them so they could reduce their weight but Dallas throws them in the bushes by the bus stop. He said no one takes lunches [like the one’s I give them] and doesn't want to be embarrassed and teased when sitting by the popular kids. Now they are working in the cafeteria to get the big lunches, as I won't pay for them anymore. Help, what can I do? Any suggestions as to how to reduce their weight would be appreciated.

<img src="Pictures/trailer.jpg" align=left> 
"Well, we've finally completed the final stage for becoming white trash," says a resigned Tiana. "We were trucker trash first, then trailer trash, and now white trash. Our little apartment is overflowing with animals. Okay, so it's only for two months, but it should be a wild two months. Of course we have Cowboy, Indian, and Scout which are our three minpins, and then in December we added Tracker (a cat) to our family. Then Scout whelped 3 puppies on Jan. 11 and Indian whelped 4 puppies on Jan. 15.” All eleven animals are working hard to keep the 'trash' tradition alive by generating as much biological waste as possible. Every little bit helps.

<b>Day 129</b>  “I don't get very cold now when I sleep outside,” says Diana with a deceptive sideways glance. “I have plastic to put over me when it rains and snows now so I don't have to wake up with a frog voice and baggy eyes.” <br>
<b>Day 137</b> “Last night it was about 15 degrees and I got a bit cold,” says Diana with a shiver. “I hadn't worn as many clothes to bed as normal and it snowed on me.  I love the cold nights best though, as I love how good it feels to have the cold air in my lungs.  I feel all moisturized on my face and lips. My face feels like baby skin now.” <br>
<b>Day 152</b> “It rained hard last night,” says a waterlogged Diana, “and I would have stayed dry if there wasn’t a big leak in the plastic right over my hip. I felt like my hip had died as it was so cold and wet. I had to dry out my sleeping bag and wash my clothes.” <br>
<b>Day 153</b> “I am not sleeping out now as it is raining,” says Diana with a sniff, “but will be out again when it stops.” <br>
<b>Day 174</b> “Our neighbors are having mountain lion trouble,” says a nervous Diana. “They are eating their dogs and other animals. I hope they don't come for me. But if they do I'll have my hockey mask to protect my face. That is why a house with a flat roof for sleeping is what I want.  A Middle Eastern home is for me." <br>
<b>Day 181</b> “I got Dad to agree to sleep outside with me tonight in the cold of winter,” says a devious Diana, “but I am not telling him it’s suppose to snow. He will be surprised to the max when he becomes a snowman tonight." <br>
<b>Day 182</b>  “Dad says he’s never sleeping outside with me again!” <br>
<b>Day 201</b> “The moon is at the fingernail point now,” says an observant Diana. “The moon is great.”

Nial, Dallas, Weston, Ammom, Braden and Soren are all active in the Scouting program and working towards their Eagles. The race is on to beat Dane, now age 38, who was the first boy in Oregon to get his Eagle Scout Award at 13 (though he actually finished at 12) and got his name in the paper for his valiant efforts. Nial has nearly completed his Eagle Project, making a trail through poison oak in the park, and is a life scout. The twins are Star Scouts and close to finishing. "Weston and I are going to get our life scout at the Court of Honor," reports Dallas. "We should also be Eagle by the end of this year, like Dane." Watch this column to keep up on their progress. <a href="scouts.html">Scout pictures.</a>

Dennis and Diana have had so many children it's often difficult to keep track of them. The problem is only compounded when you add their unusual, and often difficult to pronounce, names. But Diana has devised a way to deal with this problem; she has assigned each of her children a number based on birth order. For example: Dane, being second born is called 'number two' while Tiana is called 'number six'. It works fine for children 1-8 but what about twins Dallas and Weston? Diana's solution is to call them 'the twins' - saving herself two whole syllables on balance.

<a class=times15><center>Diana's Morning Sickness</center></a>
<img src="Pictures/prego.jpg" align=left> 
Diana, who has spent nearly 10 years of her life being pregnant, has been calculating how many years of morning sickness she’s had to deal with. “With ten children,” she begins, “I threw up for five months with each child (not counting the 5 pregnancies I lost and were sick with) how many years does that make to throw up?” The answer: 3 ¾ years of vomiting (since the twins are just one pregnancy).
