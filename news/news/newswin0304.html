<b>Melanie & Baby Joseph:</b> Baby Joseph Allen Beal was born on Monday, February 23 2004 at 3:06 p.m. to a delight family. He weighed 7 pounds 15.6 ounces and was 20 inches long. Joseph was taken two weeks early due to slight complications with the pregnancy but all went well with the eight-hour birth (a significant improvement on the 36 hours she was in labor with Soren). Joseph is Scott and Melanie's third child and Dennis and Diana's tenth grandchild. The proud parents couldn't be happier; "He is so perfect," says Joseph's elated mother, Melanie. "We are all so enchanted with him. He arrived Monday afternoon, and none too soon either! It was only eight hours of labor, but when that kind of pain is involved, time is of the essence. We named him Joseph Allen, the Allen part after Scott. The kids are so preciously gentle with him; it is one of my favorite things to watch. We went in on Monday the 23rd for an induction, I asked for and got an epidural, which lasted just till I hit transition, then it "floated". By the time the second epidural was in, 45 painful minutes later, I was at a 10 and ready to go. But his bulbous head didn't want to come out so after the vacuum, forceps and the vacuum again, we finally managed to coax him out. All was forgiven as I held him for the first time. Scott cut the cord. He was brilliant through it all and I can't stop thanking him for being so wonderful." Melanie's youngest brothers, 12-year-old twins Dallas and Weston, took pictures of Joseph to school to show everyone--announcing that they had become uncles for the 10th time! Neither the kids nor the teachers believed them.<br> 
 <b>Indie & Baby Quints:</b> After lumbering around for weeks in a painful and swollen state, Indian, Tiana and Hyrum's beautiful chocolate Min Pin finally gave birth to five puppies. She had four red and one black babies--all female except one. Sadly one died just a couple of days after the birth. All are walking around now with their eyes open and are getting into everything. Tiana and Hyrum couldn't be happier.<br>

<b>Tiana & Baby Girl:</b> Tiana is just a couple of months away from having her first child, a baby girl she is hoping to name Cayanna. She and Hyrum are very excited and have been working hard to get their house and property ready for the new addition. Heavily pregnant Tiana has even learned to operate some of the heavy digging and loading equipment used to level their hill in preparation for their new house. Diana, Tiana's mother, is stunned by her strength, "Tiana drives the loader and big equipment in rain and snow and she'd probably work a 10 hour day with Hyrum if she wasn't pregnant. She is as strong as a man and really upbeat." Tiana is due mid May. <br>

<b>Natasha & Baby ???:</b> Natasha and her partner, Steve, are expecting a baby in July. "Steve and I wanted to have a kid together," says Tasha, "but we didn't expect to be so lucky so soon. I am exited, but it's not like the first time. I'm not really that worried about anything and it's much more annoying to hear advice from people this time than last time. I know I shouldn't let it get to me but I did a pretty good job with Cage by myself...how much harder can it be with someone else actually helping me?" This will be Tasha's second child. Cage, her first child, will be ten when the baby is born.

<img src="../../Pictures/daisha.jpg" align=left>
Daisha has decided to leave the US - for good! After spending a few months in her native country, she returned to the UK (where she's been living for the past three years) to prepare for her marriage to Englishman Edward Lanyon on June 5th. The couple have bought a house in a small village just outside London and intend to live there with Dakota for many years. But Daisha isn't ruling out the possibility of returning to America just yet. "England is great but I love and miss a lot about the US. If Edward gets transferred, it'll either be to New York or Chicago so I don't think we'll be able to move back to the West Coast."

The Cluff's fifth child, Canyon, has already memorized every state in the United States. He is a child prodigy with either a great future as cartographer or as a game show contestant.

Dallas, Weston and Nail have their go-cart up and working again and are having a blast getting muddy riding around in the field doing wheelies and doughnuts. The three of them and a load of four wheelers also periodically head out to the coast with the George gang to hit the dunes. When all that dirt, mud and grime gets to be too much, they head up to Mt. Ashland for some good, clean fun. Their skiing technique has come a long way in the past two years and they are now confident enough to take bigger risks. Apparently Weston's found a "great jump between two trees." His nervous mother, Diana, isn't please with this new find, "I beg him to stay away from trees and rocks but we have a hard time keeping those boys off the slopes."

<a class=times15><center>SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Theft, Gluttony, Rodents & Addiction</center></a> <img src="Pictures/mouse.jpg" align=left>
For years Diana Cluff, seemingly self-sacrificial mother of ten, has been taking a hefty 85% "tithe" from the boys' Halloween candy and squirreling it away in the unnavigable depths of her closet. She claims that the confiscated candy will be used to stuff stockings at Christmas, but the sad reality is that the bulk of this shameful hoard is eaten up by Diana herself weeks before the holidays even arrive. By Christmastime, what little candy is left is usually too dangerous to eat. Not because it's old and out-of-date but because Diana's closet has recently been found to contain an usually large amount of rodents. The high-energy carbohydrate treats sustain not just the rat-infested closet but also the entire population of rodents for miles around. Diana refuses to be blamed for Eastern Ashland's rodent problems and resents the implication that she is greedy and crafty. In her own defence she has revealed that Shira (a convicted sugarholic) sneaks into the hoard at regular intervals as well. Far from greedy, Diana even believes her efforts are altruistic and that by taking a tithe she is saving the boys from cavities and her husband from dental bills. But the boys are unmoved by Diana's defense and just want their candy back. And so what began as an allegedly innocent, even angelic, act has now turned into a damaging and despicable lose-lose scheme creating not only familial resentment and suspicion but also hyperactive, diabetic rats. <a href='../../family/memories.html'>Click here</a> for a festive take on the ongoing rat saga.

<a class=times15><center>Drug Fuelled Attempted Murder Leaves Nial Scorched</center></a>
In a shockingly true tale of drugs and violence, Nial Cluff, age 16, has narrowly escaped being burned alive by a fellow classmate. According to Nial, a boy from school (who cannot be named for legal reasons) offered him crack twice last month before purposefully setting fire to Nial's elbow in welding class. Luckily another student in the class saw Nial's coveralls catch fire and alerted him to the fact. Nial was able to put the fire out with only one small burn to his elbow. But his coveralls didn't fare quite as well and now have a big hole in them. Despite being scorched, Nial is not bitter. "The boy is on drugs a lot of the time and acts weird," Nial says in his calm way.

Shortly after turning 12, the twins got to go to their first ever fireside. The location of the meeting was in the high Cascades. According to Dallas, both he and Weston were sitting quietly in the car on the way up, angelic as always, reviewing the ten commandments in their minds when suddenly their brother-in-law Hyrum and their cousin Torrance ganged up on them and unleashed a prolonged and totally unprovoked "titty twisting" attack. The long, winding drive up the muddy Greensprings highway was 15 miles of pure torture for the two innocent boys. Days after their initiation they were still tender. The twins' indifferent mother had this to say; " Weston wasn't happy with a car full of boys and twisting going on."

<img src="Pictures/dkkitch.jpg" align=left>
Dane has undertaken the massive task of single-handedly remodelling his family's new home in Coquille. For months on end he's painted, stripped, carpeted, knocked down, rebuilt and done up every square inch of the house--moulding and crafting each wall to his family's desire. As a dedicated family man, Dane promotes the idea of individual creativity in his children by allowing each of them a chance to let their imaginations run wild by designing their own dream room--fixtures, fittings and colors included (even neon green and purple in some cases). Each day when he comes home from work, he puts on his tatty jeans and picks up a hammer or a bucket of wallpaper stripper or a can of fuchsia paint and attacks the unadorned corners of Cluff abode with the energy of a 13 year old school boy. Dane's latest achievements include a totally revamped bathroom and a brand new kitchen (that he installed himself). Check back for updates.

<a class=times15><center>Violin Recitals Abound</center></a><img src="../../family/Pictures/kirvln.jpg" align=left>
Kira had her first non-recital violin performance Sunday, October 26. She, along with upwards of twenty other fellow students took their violins to a retirement home to play for a very enthusiastic elderly audience. They played a selection of songs ranging from 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' to Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'. To their surprise an encore was called for and they then played the unrehearsed 'Birthday Song' and the less successful 'Amazing Grace', which had some timing unity problems. Nonetheless, the concert was a hit and subsequent performances are anticipated. Dallas and Weston had their first violin recital of the school year playing for an estimated crowd of 100. They successfully played 'Old World Overture', 'Michael, Row the Boat Ashore', 'Tomahawk' and 'Little Brown Jug'. Oddly, their bows bobbed up and down in direct opposition to the rest of the orchestra--but still perfectly in time with each other.

Scott Beal, loving husband and father of 2 ï¿½, keeps in great shape by riding his bicycle to and from work everyday, a round trip of nearly 40 miles. His bike is decked out with lights, reflectors and panniers for the commute. All that exercise belies his 42 years of age. Needless to say his wife, Melanie, gets mistaken for being the oldest in their relationship (despite the nearly eight years age difference) thanks go to the early white hair genes from Mom. Friends have warned Mel that if she doesn't dye her hair soon people will mistake her for Scott's mother when they go out to eat. Once thought to be an exaggerated suggestion now looks to be a true prophesy. But Melanie is taking it all in stride. She has decided to fight against the 'mutton dressed as lamb' impulse and to happily accept her increasingly cloud-like mantle.

<a class=times15><center>Birthday Report By Diana</center></a>  
<b>The twins</b> turned 12 on January 3rd. They spent the day with Nial and Hyrum on Mt. Ashland skiing. They also had some school boys over for a taffy pull and party. Most of all they couldn't wait to be ordained to the priesthood. That happened Sunday just before our fast and testimony meeting with Dad, Grandpa Airplane, Hyrum and the Bishop. After they were ordained they sat on the bench in the chapel and Hyrum instructed them on passing the sacrament. All went well and they were so thrilled with it all. Weston was so happy, he had a hard time trying to keep from smiling. The twins shaved for the first time the other day. They came in very proud of themselves with faces that looked exactly the same as they did before they shaved. I guess they are growing up. They are getting much bigger every month. Dallas weighs in at 150 now and Weston at 125. They are both about 5'4". They still "twin-talk" and laugh their heads off as they punch each other and wrestle daily. When I cut their hair they have identical cowlicks in the same place at the back of their heads. I am sure they are identical now with the way they look, their many extra teeth, the way they are so close and can read each other's mind and have a special language that only Daisha has partially figured out.<br> 
<b>Nial</b> turned 16 on Febuary 3rd and is finally beginning to cram for his Eagle so he can get a license to drive. He seems to be a popular man at school with at least three girls who keep the calls coming to our house. "I can't believe what a girl-magnet he is," says his stunned mother.

In an ongoing and mysterious saga, Nial's eye has once again gone puffy. From birth Nial has had trouble with his eyes. He has frequently endured eye sties, pink eye and a weird puffy, weepy, redness for which there is no cause or cure. Once Nial was even diagnosed with having eyelash dandruff (a real turn-on for the ladies)! At school Nial is forced to come up with increasingly exotic excuses for his reoccurring problem. His latest excuse; "I got into a fight with a squirrel. He got in a couple of lucky punches, but in the end I feel I won." Though destined for a life of ocular trauma, Nial calmly accepts his fate and looks forward to a brighter future--through the one eye that isn't currently sealed shut.

<a class=times15><center>A Thin Line Between Love & Hate</a> by Shira Cluff</center><img src="../../peoplepages/shira/Pictures/shisum.jpg" align=left>
When I live at home I wake up each morning only to look forward to eating a small bowl of stale oatmeal and skim milk, which hardly sustains my hunger until lunchtime. At lunch I go eat an apple (which I have to get by literally climbing one of the apple trees in our yard--then ones you can easily pluck off the ground are definitely inedible--but the risk is never worth it because I end up biting into the nastiest, brown, putrid rot of a worm's hole because not one of the apples in our yard is worm-hole-free) or maybe have a little bean and onion soup, only enough to fill my shrivelled, gaseous stomach until dinner when, if I am lucky, I fix myself an egg. That is ALL that there is to offer at my house that fits in with my diet, if you don't count what I can salvage out of the mulch bucket. When I am really lucky Daisha and I will go to Wal-Mart where I will stock up on sugar free candies and chocolates only to be wishing I hadn't, hours later, when my aching stomach, making all sorts of strange and unearthly noises, bubbles and I sit on the pot with the worst diarrhea anyone anywhere is truly able to experience. That's only if I get really lucky, as I've already said. Don't get me wrong, actually I've never eaten so well and been so skinny at the same time. Plus the yard work really subtracts in places where the lack of food and nutrition misses. However, the funny thing is, as I sit here in Portland, after having afforded a day's digestional workout of omelettes, buttered toast, hash browns, fish 'n' chips, bangers 'n' mash, sodas, muffins, chocolate cream pie and candy, I really do realize how much better I feel when the day is done, all the nails have been pried from an endless stack of ply wood, hauled to the fire-pit, and are ready for a hot dog roast, the last of the rotted apples have been collected for applesauce, the watering is finished and Rich Wilford took no part in it, the condiments have been removed, then replaced (something they call cleaning the fridge) though I can't tell the difference, and I lie in bed having eaten just enough to keep me alive, food that just barely tastes good enough that I don't start searching for room and board elsewhere, yet at the same time gives me the satisfaction of feeling tired at 8pm, having the energy to wake up before noon, of being able to sleep through Dallas's snoring, of actually witnessing my body, first hand, self-depreciate - my Cluff thighs..., disintegrate, and that, is the best feeling of all. At this instant I am so sick to my stomach from eating so much junk food; I truly wish I was at home eating that delicious bean and onion soup and happily snug in my 0-degree sleeping bag. I am being completely sincere.

Karen Cluff, loving mother of five, has gone to new lengths today by breaking her old personal-best hair length record despite having hacked off nearly three feet last summer! This startling information is casting new doubts on the old idea that everyone's hair grows at the same rate. Jealous sisters-in-law Daisha and Melanie, for example, can only achieve 1/100th of the growth rate Karen is getting. But Karen admits that having over productive hyper-hair isn't always a blessing. "It's constantly getting caught, pulled, blown around, yanked and ripped out." Though her Godiva-like hair is at times difficult to manage (takes two people to wash) she still feels it's worth it. And so too does her mother-in-law who raves about her long, golden locks non-stop, "Karen's hair gives her such a soft, feminine look. It's amazing to see how much attention she gets. She's complimented all day long, wherever she goes!" And so she should be.

They were warned. People said they were crazy. Doctors said it was dangerous, that it was over-ambitious, but at 53 and 47, Dennis and Diana Cluff became parents for the 9th and 10th time--to twins! And now, 12 years down the road, how have they fared? For the first time in Cluff history, Diana has publicly admitted to feeling exhausted. Not an outright admission of defeat but satisfying, nontheless, for outdone forty-something women the world over. "After 40 years of marriage," Diana sighs, "finally our last children are growing up. Good thing, Dennis and I look and feel half dead, but are happy with our 40 years of helping our family to be and progress."

Tiana and Hyrum, true to their pioneer roots, bought a patch of property on top of a forested hill near Table Rock with stunningly beautiful panoramic views that include Mt.

Luckily, Tiana seems to be immune to the poisonous plants but poor Hyrum has been stricken at least a half a dozen times (see <a href="newsfal03.html">Hyrum's Masculine Itch</a> in the Fall 2003 edition). Each Saturday for the last several months they've enlisted the twins to help them fight and kill the poison oak on their property.

The twins want to beat Dane, now age 37, who was the first boy in Oregon to get his Eagle Scout at age 13 (though he actually finished at 12) and got his name in the paper for his valiant efforts.
