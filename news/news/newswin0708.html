<img src="Pictures/theatre.jpg" align=left>After attending a traditional Christmas Pantomime at the Old Vic Theatre in London, the Lanyon family were walking towards the south bank of the river Thames to catch their train when they decided to take a shortcut through a dark alley. Big mistake. "Suddenly," begins a disgusted Daisha, "we rolled over the biggest, nastiest, stinkiest pile of poo in the whole wide world. I mean, it was bad! It couldn't have been a dog because the sheer volume would've put a pack of Great Danes to shame! The only thing I could think was that it was some kind of secret dumping site for a big group of people who had just been to a really dodgy Indian restaurant and contracted 'Delhi belly' - it was that much! Anyway, before we knew what was happening, Tabitha's stroller had rolled straight through it! It was everywhere; all over the wheels, on the frame, all up in the mechanism and now flipping up onto the fabric! Ugh, it was foul! And there was nothing we could do so we <b>abandoned</b> the stroller next to the nearest garbage can - which happened to be in front of the National Theatre. As we walked briskly away from the stink bomb we were giggling... until we were struck by a sobering thought; in London you are not allowed to leave bags, boxes or equipment lying around unattended because of the terrorist threat (old throwback to the IRA days). What if theatre security saw/smelled the stroller and thought it was a chemical bomb threat?! It was definitely funky enough to arouse suspicion! We hung our heads in shame as we imagined throngs of frightened people being evacuated from the auditorium. But we had a train to catch, so we legged it! I'm sure the Lanyon gang's CCTVed faces are on some kind of criminal computer database now! Oh well. The next day we went stroller shopping and were able to upgrade Tabby's ride - so we were please with how it all came out in the end (if you'll excuse the bad pun!)."

<a class=times15><center>Virtual Injuries</center></a>
Since getting a Wii for Christmas the Lanyon's health has been in significant decline. For weeks now they've all suffered from various virtual bowling injuries. Dakota's shoulder is tender, Daisha has a rotator cuff injury and Edward gets a nasty hand cramp every time he grips the controller! "I guess most people don't have it this rough," begins Daisha, "but we're a VERY competitive family!"

<a class=times15><center>Tabby's Favorite Prime Minister</center></a>
On Pancake Day (the day before Lent) it's traditional to use up all your nice ingredients (eggs, sugar, etc) before the period of fasting by making pancakes. Most people in Britain still have pancakes on this day - even if they don't do the religious bit. "We were carrying on the tradition," begins Daisha "and two year old Tabitha was helping me in the kitchen. I was telling her that the best ones are 'golden brown' to which she replied; 'NO! I don�t like Gordon Brown I like Tony Blair!!!' I nearly fell over from the shock! Who knew she was so politically minded?!"

<a class=times15><center>Reading Maniac</center></a>
Tabitha has shocked her family by showing interest in learning to read at the age of two. Before her third birthday she was already well on her way - having learned to sound out hundreds of words and even sight read dozens of words! "I can only say," begins Tabby's flabbergasted mother, Daisha, "that she didn't get it from me!"

<a class=times15><center>Update on Shira</center></a>
At college this year Shira is taking psychology, geology and painting. Her fabulous skills with a paintbrush have won her a $1500 art scholarship for 2008/09 and a semi-private studio on campus. "I'm stoked!" Shira exclaims. "Things are going great and Sophia is being babysat by Ammon and occasionally Karen and Mom while I'm at school. Ammon is doing a great job! I've been working for Art FX, with Dane, stringing black diamonds, mostly, and finding out just how bad of a salesperson I really am. Sophia and I spent Valentine's Day with our friends making Sushi. We also got to visit Tiana before she has her baby, to take some great pictures for posterity. And I put the first payment on the Malibu I'm buying from Tiana and Hyrum."

Tabitha has been attending "Crafty Tots" of late. Crafty Tots is a toddler's club with kid-friendly arts and crafts stations including painting, clay, coloring, cutting & sticking, seasonal crafts, etc. "I can't tell you how nice it is," begins Daisha, "for someone else to do all the boring setting up and cleaning up while we have all the fun. I love that Tabby can make a gigantic mess and I don't have to clean it up. Junk like glitter and paint is impossible to get out of the carpet!"

<a class=times15><center>Kiersa Milly: The Gift of Love</center></a><img src="Pictures/kierbb.jpg" align=right>
It's a girl! Tiana and Hyrum's third child, Kiersa Milly, was born in the early hours of February 14th. Hyrum says that little Kiersa was his Valentine's present to Tiana. She weighed in at 7 lbs 10 oz and was 21" long. "This was the best labor, delivery, epidural and recovery of all three of my kids," says Tiana. "Poor little Kiersa started out looking like a hairless troll, but she's getting cuter every day now that she's not so puffy and smashed. Hyatt keeps saying "Ahhhh" and "Ohhhhh" when he sees her, and Talea wants to do everything for her since she feels like a pro now with all the stuff she's done at the doctor's and hospital. She'll probably end up an OB after this experience. It all started on Wednesday, the 13th, when I felt an urgent need to move our stuff into the apartment we plan to live in during our remodel. I started contracting, but it was really mild. I had Hyrum check my progress anyway (yes, he was instructed by my doctor how to check dilation and effacement), and I had dilated to a 6-7 already after only a few hours of almost painless contractions!<img src="Pictures/hytikier.jpg" align=left> We arrived at the hospital around 10:45 pm on the 13th, and Kiersa Milly was born at 2:34 am on the 14th, Valentine�s Day. Hyrum and Hyatt were sick as dogs during the whole thing, so they wore germ masks the entire time. Talea watched the whole thing and loved every minute of it! She squealed with excitement once she saw the head crown and I could tell how well I was pushing just by listening to the sounds of her excitement. Hyrum was the one who delivered the baby, with the doctor's assistance (he delivered Hyatt also), and all the nurses told Hyrum he missed his calling in life and that he should go back to school and become a labor and delivery nurse or an OB. It was Talea�s job to announce the sex of the baby (this one was a surprise for us). Talea got to bathe the baby with Hyrum and they put the baby's footprints on her shirt. It was such a great experience for Talea and she's really bonded tight with her little sister.

<b>The Johnsons:</b> "Nial was staying with us to dig under the house," reports Tiana. "And we also had Dallas at our house for Christmas. Mom sent some dollar store stocking stuffers up with him, but we felt bad he didn�t have any presents to unwrap with us so we got him some AXE products to make him popular with the ladies, or so the commercials say they will. We all sat around in our new jammies (including Dallas) and opened presents and gorged ourselves on candy. We didn�t really decorate too much because we�re remodeling and I didn�t want one more giant mess to clean up on top of all the other messes I have. It was a leisurely Christmas, but not an eventful one, except that I got a robotic vacuum that does all the work for me! It�s the best invention! It rocks my world."<br>

<b>The Cluffers:</b> CHRISTMAS!! What a trip! Snow everywhere!" exclaims Karen. "We got snowed out of town but luckily only missed a day of church and no school.

But Alternative, Dance, and Rock are my favorites.<img src="Pictures/braleap.jpg" align=left> I'm still playing bass, and working on the band thing, although that isn't really moving right now... I'm waiting for highschool so I can find some people who are really into music like me and who are really into making a band. I just need to find the right people...<br>

<b>The Lanyons:</b> The Lanyons stayed in the UK for Christmas this year (the first time since Tabitha was born) and planned to have traditional English Christmas complete with a cozy family gathering, carols at midnight mass and a big festive lunch. However, things didn't quite go to plan when Edward came down with a high fever on Christmas Eve (giving us all horrifying flashbacks of Vomfest '06!).

Every Cluff has a great traveling disaster story to tell because we've all been on at least one motorhome "adventure". So <i>reliable</i> are these motorhome trip mishaps that for years now nearly everyone has refused to go anywhere in them. Both motorhomes are now permanently parked in the Cluff compound and used for Diana�s overflow closet storage. But Cluff traveling disasters aren�t limited to the motorhome alone, oh no, they apply to airplanes, boats, bicycles and every single vehicle that dares to merge onto the asphalt, take to the skies, launch into the water or otherwise. In their travels, the Cluffs have encountered everything from a dead battery to a dead animal in the engine. And even more worrying, a genetic legacy seems to be emerging. Once disaster were strictly limited to vehicles owned by Dennis and Diana, but now just being related makes you susceptible, even by marriage! If you travel with someone of Cluff extraction, you risk the horror of the �Cluff Curse�! Bwah ha ha ha! Bwah ha ha ha! The following stories illustrate our point:<br> 
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #1 - Diana <br>
<i>There's Nor-way We'll Go Back Again</i></center></a>
"Norway is nice," begins reluctant traveler, Diana, "but it can also be a stressful workout because there are no drinking fountains, the restrooms (which you have to pay for) all seem to be hidden and everything costs so much! Just one hamburger and drink at Burger King is over $15.00! It was incredibly expensive for a hotel room so we stayed in a hostel but Dad couldn�t sleep as all the beds were filled with snoring men from the Middle East. He spent the night up in the TV room looking at maps and planning. Then when it came to the shower in the morning there weren�t any towels or soap. We weren�t told this before hand and I had to use a paper napkin in my purse to dry my entire body! Dad used his dirty underwear to dry off! But it wasn't all bad, the Norwegians are great people and very helpful. Dad had taken his walker to help his legs and had a hard time getting up and down on the street cars. He almost fell on an escalator at one point but a big Norwegian man reached down and saved him with one giant arm. Another time Dad got stuck on some steps and said, 'Oh crap!' I told him he shouldn�t say that word as it might shock the locals since they all know English. Later, we were getting on a bus and I hit a man with my backpack and said, 'Oh, sorry I banged you' and Dennis said that what I just said was much worse! I didn't understand until he told me later that 'banged' means SEX in Europe!"
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #2 - Tasha <br>
<i>The Great Vomfest of 2006!</i></center></a>
"I think the worst vacation was last X-mas where we came to visit the fam and Steve had a good 10 hours with our eccentric family before he spent the next four days throwing up in a hotel room. I don't even think it was Mom's food, even though that was my first suspicion."
<hr>


<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #3 - Tiana<br>
<i>Too Many to Choose Just One!</i></center></a>
A. "Could it be when Hyrum and I drove to Utah with Talea when she was 3 months old and she cried the 12 hours there and the 12 hours back, so I had to lean over the car seat to nurse her and ended up with bruised ribs from it?" <br>
B. "Could it be the short trips where every time we drive over to I-5 or back on the coastal roads Talea gets carsick and pukes?"<br>
C. "Would it be the awesome trip to the Jellybean factory we took with the Lanyons where Hyatt ended up so sick we had to take him to the hospital on our way back home?"<br>
D. "I think the worst traveling story is when Hyrum and I were on the semi and only Hyrum knew how to drive at the time. We were driving flatbed through Colorado hauling barrels of something. Hyrum stopped on a pullout beside the freeway because the load had shifted, and he was on the trailer wrenching around on the stuff trying to get it to move back. I was in the cab looking in the mirror at what appeared to be my first gray hair. I couldn�t wait for Hyrum to get back in the truck so I could show it to him, but when the door opened, something was very wrong. Hyrum had flown off the flatbed when the bar he was wrenching on slipped and he landed on his back in the road. He had the wind knocked out of him, but had to roll over under the trailer so he wouldn�t get hit by anyone. He tried to call to me, but I couldn�t hear him, so he had to hobble over to the truck in excruciating pain. He then had to pull himself up into the driver seat and drive himself to the hospital because I had no clue how to drive and shift the truck at that time. He got x-rayed at the hospital and it turned out there were no broken bones, and his diagnosis for such horrific pain was a �buttock contusion�, which is a bruised bottom (it took about a week for the bruise to show up, but it was nasty, and it was just above his �buttocks�). We were headed to Tasha�s in Seattle with our load, but we stopped in Mountain Home, Idaho to get some Vicodin for the pain and we ended up not getting to see Tash for long because it took us so long to drive the distance in so much pain. That has to be my worst memory for traveling."
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #4 - Hyrum<br>
<i>The Candyman's Revenge</i></center></a>
"Hyrum had overloaded on sugarless candy (even though the warning had cautioned to eat only a few or it would have a laxative effect) while I was sleeping in the back of the truck, then suddenly I felt the truck come to an incredibly fast stop. I thought maybe we were being pulled over, but it was too fast. Before I could even sit up and stick my head through the curtains, Hyrum was out the door and doing the squeeze-your-cheeks run. He said it hit him so suddenly that he was going to pull over and use the garbage can out of desperation until he happened to look to the side and see a couple of outhouses parked in a field. I looked out the curtain and saw him duck into one of the outhouses. Lucky for him, there was a pair of outhouses someone had put out for construction in the middle of nowhere. I watched the outhouse while I laughed my head off and then I saw him peek his head out of the door. He glanced around to see if anyone was looking and he ran around to the other outhouse with his shorts still down under his hind end. I knew he must not have toilet paper. All I had was paper towels, but I grabbed them and watched to see if his head popped out of the second outhouse. Sure enough, just moments later he peeked out and looked in desperation to the truck and saw that I was holding the paper towels out. I took them over to him as I laughed at his plight. Poor guy. That was the closest he�s been to a South American missionary brown-out. Fortunately for him, he learned his lesson and avoided the sugarless candy from then on. Now if we can only get him to avoid the steak and all-you-can-eat shrimp at Sizzlers�"
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #5 - Edward<br>
<i>Meeting The Cluffs</i></center></a>
"The first time I went to the US I met the Cluffs at San Francisco airport, which we liked so much we stayed there for almost 24 hours. Within a couple of hours I was firmly ensconced at the heart of the family, on my knees, in a motorhome, being encouraged to solicit the almighty to intervene and make just a small one-off exception on our behalf, to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, in order to get the battery working (I'm still reeling from the shock of the omission of this methodology from any of my electrical engineering lectures... perhaps I wasted 4 years of my life?)"
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>Disaster Contestant #6 - Dallas <br>
<i>My Least Favorite Trip</i></center></a>
"One time Mom, Dad, Weston, Nial and me decided to go camping at Lost Lake," begins Dallas with an all-knowing gleam in his eye. "We decided to leave Monday so we packed all our stuff in the motorhome and got it ready but didn't leave until Wednesday - that's how bad it was! We started up the R.V. (with a little help - of course) and took off. We had to get gas so we headed over the bridge by exit 14 but as we did the engine caught on FIRE! We hadn't even gone a mile!!! Good huh?"
<hr>

<a class=times15><center>And the Winner is...</center></a><img src="Pictures/1st.jpg" align=left>
Thanks to all who participated. It was a close call and we loved all the entries, but the winner has to be... disaster #6! Congratulations Dallas, you win the DVD of your choice! It's hard to beat a good ol' motorhome story, especially when the preparation for the trip is much longer than the actual trip itself!!

<img src="Pictures/ticket.jpg" align=left><img src="Pictures/ticket.jpg" align=right><a class=times15><center>Tuffcluff Film Club</center></a><br><br><b>DECEMBER:</b><br>
<b>Swiss Family Robinson</b> (1960) At first glance this may not seem like a Christmas movie, but take a closer look and you'll find a festive little Christmas section tucked in there somewhere between the cross-dressing and the coconut bombs! See, this little gem is much more exciting than you remember. And it's implanted some of us with a life-long desire to be stranded on an deserted isle!
<br>
<br>
<b>JANUARY:</b><br>
<b>The Great Race</b> (1965) This is an all time Cluff favorite with dozens of great one liners that are still in circulation among the first batch to this day! The iceburg scene gives it a nice themey feel for January, but there's more - so much more. If you haven't introduced your kids to this one, you're doing them a disservice. It's whole lot of fun for the entire family - and anyone who thinks different shouldn'ta, hadn'ta, oughtn'ta!   
<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY:</b><br> <img src="Pictures/vicar.jpg" align=left>
<b>The Vicar of Dibley</b> (1994-2007) Ok, ok, it's not a movie but it's a seriously funny British sitcom with a bit of romance thrown in. This little series will make you thankful for those long winter nights - so you can spend them watching the next episode! There are only 18 episodes and five specials in all. It may be difficult to get hold of in the US, but it IS available on Netflix. Give it a chance (at least a few episodes to get into the swing of things) and you won't be disappointed! 
<br>
<br>
<b>WILDCARD:</b><br><b>Kind Hearts and Coronets</b> (1949) A Fab British black comedy! You'll die laughing at the talented Alec Guinness playing half of the movie's characters. And if that isn't enough, Time magazine rates it on their top 100 list!<br>

Talea's only three years old but she's as tough as nails! "Hyatt had to get two shots," reports Tiana, "and got band-aids for them, so Talea wanted a shot to get a band-aid too! They gave her a flu shot and she didn't even cry. They were amazed that she would request a shot. They'd never heard that before. Then after she got the first shot she asked for a second one so she could have two band-aids instead of one. They just gave her a second band-aid after they scooped their jaws off the floor!"

<a class=times15><center>Mrs. Cluff's Wild Ride</center></a>
"I rode in the fun, loud-music-blasting car of wild-driving Weston," reports borderline geriatric mother, Diana, "and I was telling him to drive slower constantly and to stay on the right side of the road. He speeds too much and we almost had three accidents that would have been his fault! The worst time was when he decided to turn in front of a 18 wheeler a few feet before the truck passed us. My scream made Weston change his mind and he jerked back to our lane in time to live. Weston had a junker car given to him by the towing people across the street and it is scary to ride in because of all the noises it makes. The good thing is, Weston works on it and is getting good at fixing cars. Now that the twins are 16, Weston has taken to driving his car by himself even though he doesn't have his license yet. Yesterday he, Dallas and Ammon took off up Hwy 66 on the hour long drive to Ammon's family home in the mountains. The road is just full of huge cliffs, hundreds of feet high, with no guard rails and ice and snow all over the road. When they got up the hill, Ammon decided to stay home so the Twins took off on their own down the 12 mile road before they turned onto Hwy 66 where the huge cliffs are. Yes, they got stuck once and someone pulled them out and then they ran off the road and hit a snow bank which left their front tires up in the air. Dallas is always jumping on Weston's car to torment him, so it was the most natural thing in the world for him to jump up on the roof - but this time he broke off the luggage rack then sat on the hood and used the pole for leverage to push backward as Weston put the car in reverse and gunned it! I have to say, working out in the weight room has really helped him gain extra power in his already over-blessed muscular arms. Dallas's plan worked and they got out of the jam. They were only stranded about an hour and said they wished they had a cell phone to call for help. But not having one made Dallas come up with his survivor-man plan which impressed Weston. This was Weston's third time to drive or to try to drive by himself since he turned 16 (that I know of). It's all been for emergencies, but still the boys need to get licences or a cell phone before they attempt it again."

<a class=times15><center>Tea for Two</center></a>
Edward and Daisha recently spent a lovely afternoon together in London having tea at the Ritz. To have tea at the Ritz you need to book three months in advance and, much to Edward's chagrin, adhere to a strict dress code. "It was amazing," remembers Daisha, "like we were stepping back in time. It felt like a film set. The sandwiches, scones and cakes were all delicious and the service was great. I'm so lucky to have a husband who thinks of doing romantic things like this for me despite the fact that I'm hopeless (I kept forgetting to use the tea strainer!). I'm such a peasant!"

"I've really gotten into art as a possible career," reveals Cage, "and am considering going into Architecture when I grow up. I'm still really unsure about a future career for myself because I love so many things right now, but I think I'm really set into something artistic (for sure!). Also, I get a lot of inspiration from my family, people I see, and the places I go. I also get quite a lot from my dreams and feelings. It's almost impossible to describe how much I love to draw and create new things, and I'm quite possibly in love with expressing myself through art."

<a class=times15><center>Potty Training Diaries</center></a> 
<b>Sophia</b>: "Sophia is potty-trained half way!" reports Shira.<br>
<b>Tabitha</b>: "After months of trying, unsuccessfully, to potty train Tabitha," says an exhausted Daisha, "I was shocked to hear her teachers tell me that she was so good at using the toilet now that she didn't need help anymore. This was shocking, really, really shocking, because at home, no matter what I'd tried, she hadn't even ATTEMPTED to potty train yet. I mean nothing! And they were saying that she�d been fully potty trained for months now! Whatever!! <br>
<b>Hyatt</b>: "Hyatt has decided he�s ready to start potty training!" says Tiana. "We got tired of his nasty poopy diapers, so today we kept him out of a diaper (just underwear, no pants), and he did so well! All day he used the toilet, and he only peed in 2 pairs of underwear. And each of those 2 times he stopped once he started and he finished on the toilet, then he went and got a rag and cleaned the mess up himself. I�m really proud of him because I�ve never seen a kid do so well on their first day. I didn�t even keep track of taking him to the toilet all the time because he taught himself how to pull his underwear off, put the potty seat on the toilet, and climb up. Several times he went in by himself and came out saying �I did it!�, so I�d check and sure enough he had gone in the toilet without me even telling him to. Then tonight after he was diapered and in his jammies, I found him stripped down to a diaper and I asked him why he was naked and trying to take his diaper off and he said �toilet�, so I put him on the toilet and he peed! I�m pretty amazed. He might have taken forever to talk, but he walked early and he�s potty training pretty easily on his first day."

<a class=times15><center>Cold Snap</center></a><img src="Pictures/diasnow.jpg" align=left>
<b>Diana:</b>
"When I heard there were funny pictures of me in the snow floating around on email, I suddenly remembered that I had worn my night clothes for sleeping outside, four layers of sweats! When I heard the gang was going that morning and decided to go at the last minute, I didn't have much to do to get ready as I only had to grab a coat, hat, scarf, boots and gloves."<br>
<b>The Johnsons:</b>
"We had one day of snow this year!" says Tiana. "We always have to go over toward Ashland to find snow, but we finally got one day of snow and actually made a snowman! It�s always exciting for us when it snows here since it�s so infrequent. Usually the kids have to resort to trying to make snowballs out of hail."
<br>
<b>The Cluffs:</b> "We've been having icy weather," shivers Diana. "It's been so cold that the pipes in the barn burst and the bathroom flooded. During the height of the cold snap we had our Christmas program at the church. Dallas was Joseph in the stable scene and wore shorts, short sleeves and flipflops under his bible costume so he wouldn't be too hot, but when we arrived we found out that the whole program was to be outside on the church lawn! Mary and the babe almost died! The choir of frozen teenagers, some without coats and dressed in t-shirts, had to sing for over a half hour in the 20 degree weather! It was supposed to be a sweet scene of the birth of the Savior, but most people were so cold that they gave a quick look at the scene and rushed into the church to warm up. My complaint of child abuse was laughed at. America doesn't respect their old people. When you are 50, you are a has-been."<br>
<b>The Cluffers:</b><img src="Pictures/cluffkidsnow.jpg" align=left>
"Snow, snow, snow, ice, snow, ice and more snow," is how Karen describes their winter. "Oh yeah, we moved too! A very hectic and fun winter though. We moved from our home in Coquille that I loved right before Christmas and spent Christmas up on the Troutman property up the Green Springs. We live in a tiny little shack and love being in the back-woods. It's a lot of fun up there with the wildlife. We see wild horses, deer, skunks, rabbits, and lots more on a regular basis. Some wildlife even finds its way into our little shack, but Arrow takes care of those. Dane's working hard learning the jewelry business. It's tough when your eyesight is not as great as it once was, but he is doing really good and picking it up."

<a class=times15><center>The Lanyon's Bad Week</center></a>
"First a water pipe burst in our front yard," says a disgruntled Daisha, "then the washing machine died, then the car packed up and took two days to be fixed, then we had a ton of rain and our massive brick wall in the back of the garden collapsed into the pub garden behind us - crushing their fence, then the new washer came but the guy installing it broke our plumbing, causing two leaks - and all of this in just one fun-filled week. Luckily, now everything is fixed and back to normal but I certainly sympathize with the old saying, 'when it rains, it pours'."

1. To get white teeth for very little money, use CREST toothpaste with whitener. My last tube, a medium size, only cost a dollar. The large tube is around three dollars but it really works better than the expensive whiteners I have tried. It is worth the money and helps prevent cavities better than normal toothpaste.<br> 
2. If you have a sweet-tooth but want to prevent cavities - brush as soon as you eat a sweet. I learned this from the dentist's office. It's a pain to brush as soon as you eat a sweet but not as much pain as the hundred dollar charge for a cavity, or over a thousand for a root canal. Always carry a toothbrush with you like you do a comb.<br> 
3. When you brush your teeth, you don't feel like eating anymore. THIS IS A FANTASTIC WEIGHT LOSS TIP!

<a class=times15><center>Sleeping Outside Part</center></a> <img src="Pictures/sleep.jpg" align=left>
"We've been having a cold snap," says Diana. "I had to come inside the house at 2am the other night as it was just too cold. 17 degrees is my favorite weather for sleeping outdoors, but it seemed colder than that. I heard something huge fall on my porch and shined my flashlight around to see what it was but couldn't find anything until morning when I saw that a big cottonwood tree limb had snapped off and fell inches from where I sleep. It was a narrow escape!"

<a class=times15><center>Floppy Haired Frank is Hot Stuff!</center></a>	 
"On Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Frank is the best of all the dancers," raves Diana. "He is one of the best dancers I have ever seen. I saw him in another movie where his dancing was more outstanding and couldn't believe his skill. I don't know why he didn't become famous. Maybe it is because his acting is a little overdone."
